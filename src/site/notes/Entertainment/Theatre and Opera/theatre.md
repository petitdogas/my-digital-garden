# Musicals
## The Lion King

The best musical (and theatrical production) I have ever seen. Managed to get free tickets for the 20th anniversary of The Lion King. Classic songs from The Lion King - what's not to love?

Rating: 5/5


## Matilda

My mummy says I'm a miracle. Tickets were £5 so definitely worth the price, and the seats even at the back were rather decent. The play itself was rather overhyped - I've been to other performances which never made it to the West End but were leagues better, but it was amazing to see the children perform. The music was solid and rather memorable, though that may be because I have the songs added on [my Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7f5KIZBfVpgwnWoeBxW1aw?si=354c3474a7d3422f).

## We Will Rock You: The Musical
05/06/2023

In the far, far future, there is a world where Rock 'n' Roll is outlawed and everyone listens to boring AI-generated music on their iPhone 90. Join a group of musicians trying to save the world and free Rock 'n' Roll.
Look me in the eyes and tell me that doesn't sound super boomer to you.
The average age of the audience was probably 40, and that's factoring in me, Youyou, and Jesse dragging down the mean average.
The only redeeming feature was Sir Brain May hopping on stage at the end playing Bohemian Rhapsody, which we would have missed had we gone through with our plans to leave early.

Watched with a large group and managed to get front-row seats (the front row was a bench and sometimes couldn't see the action right at the back of the stage, but all in all amazing seats). Had pizza beforehand and Ethan won some drinks, which he couldn't redeem because he wasn't 18 for another 5 hours.
The show itself was fantastic, especially considering its £5 price, and really engaging. The Grand High with kept on pointing at me specifically as I was the youngest-looking person at the front. The music was some of the best I've heard in theatres, but, unfortunately, is not available online.

I really was not expecting anything amazing beforehand - a live action theatrical production of an anime tends not to excite one. However, I had heard that MatPat was involved in the production, so was at least excited about that. Plotwise, one of the characters from the show is written out of the play, and the pace of the action was a bit iffy at times (seriously, who spends 5 minutes singing about a bicycle and then rushes a hospital scene?).
The music was great - not amazing, but definitely above average. The only real issue with the music was the volume - every single song was extremely loud, which took away from the excitement of the songs, and made every song have the same level of "mid" impact.
Kousuke was literally just Wilson Fung.

# Plays
## The Unfriend

I was (willingly) dragged along by my sister to watch this play. Before going in, the reviews said it would be awful, and boy were they correct. We only really went to see Lee Mack, so surely it would have been a great comedy, right?
There was toilet humour. There was Donald Trump humour. It was all boomer humour, and, just as with [[Entertainment/Theatre and Opera/theatre#We Will Rock You The Musical\|We Will Rock You: The Musical]], the average audience age was about 40.
