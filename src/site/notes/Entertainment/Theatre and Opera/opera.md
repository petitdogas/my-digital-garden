This was the first opera I ever watched and quite frankly I don't understand why I decided to give opera a second try after this. The main character dies off screen sailing away as though he were Iggle Piggle and his personality is completely irredeemable.
The only funny thing of note was when he hit the woman he wanted to marry.
In fact, this opera was so boring that the people seated near me disappeared in between acts never to return.
At least the cafe with Youyou was nice (I am so fat).

## Plot as I understood it

Peter Grimes' first apprentice dies at sea due to mysterious circumstances and then some guy tells him he's got a new apprentice for Grimes. The naval officer tells Grimes to not get a new apprentice because he's probably going to die, but Peter Grimes gets one anyway. Pathetic fallacy - there's a storm that night and things happen. Here, we find out that Peter Grimes wants to marry Ellen and become rich.
A few days later, Ellen notices the apprentice has a bruise on his neck and refuses to say anything about it. She tells Peter Grimes to give the child a day off, but he refuses and then hits her, which the whole town finds out about.
Peter Grimes gets his apprentice to climb down the cliff (which had been destroyed by the storm earlier) but lets go off the rope holding the apprentice when some inspectors come to his door - he assumes the apprentice betrayed him but did not intend to kill him. He runs away.
The village says they have proof Peter Grimes killed his apprentices and there's a manhunt for him. Peter Grimes sails away and dies off screen.


> [!example]- Actual Plot
> Prologue<br>A boy apprenticed to the fisherman Peter Grimes has died at sea. An inquest is being held to determine the cause of death. After hearing Grimes’s testimony, the coroner, Mr Swallow, finds that the boy died in ‘accidental circumstances’. He warns Grimes not to get another apprentice. Grimes demands a full trial and the right to employ another boy. His pleas are ignored and the court is cleared. Ellen Orford, the local schoolteacher, assures Peter that with her help the future will be better.<br>Act 1<br>Scene 1: Morning<br>The Borough goes about its business. Grimes returns from fishing; only Captain Balstrode, a retired naval officer, and Ned Keene, the local apothecary, are willing to help bring in his boat. Keene tells Grimes he has arranged for a new apprentice from the workhouse. The carter, Hobson, at first refuses to fetch the boy, but consents when Ellen offers to look after the child on the journey. As a storm brews, Balstrode tries to dissuade Grimes from a course he fears will result in another tragedy, but Grimes is determined to get rich, marry Ellen and thus silence the Borough gossips.<br>Scene 2: The Boar<br>Late that night, the storm has reached hurricane force. To the annoyance of Auntie, the landlady, Mrs Sedley arrives to wait for Ned Keene. He has promised to meet her there with a new supply of laudanum. Auntie’s ‘nieces’ enter The Boar and fail to escape the advances of Balstrode and Bob Boles, the Methodist preacher. At the height of the storm, Ned Keene enters with news that the cliff by Grimes’s hut has been washed away. He is followed by Grimes himself: it is as if the eye of the storm has entered the room. Ellen and the new apprentice arrive, soaked and exhausted from their journey; before the boy can rest, Grimes insists on taking him straight home. He drags him off into the night.<br>Act 2<br>Scene 1: Sunday morning<br>Ellen is sitting on the beach with John, the new apprentice, while the church service begins. She encourages the boy to talk about himself, but he says nothing. Only then does she notice the bruising on his neck and immediately fears the worst. Grimes comes to take the boy off fishing. Ellen pleads for the boy’s right for a day of rest. When Peter refuses, she tells him that their attempt to make a new start has failed. Peter, in a frenzy, hits out at her and rushes off with the boy. This scene has been witnessed, and when the congregation comes out of church there is a call for action against Grimes. The men set out for his hut. Auntie, Ellen and the ‘nieces’ are left alone to reflect on the hopelessness of loving men.<br>Scene 2: Grimes’s hut<br>Grimes orders the boy to get ready for fishing. Haunted by the death of the last apprentice, he feels his dream of marrying Ellen slipping away. When he hears the men from the Borough approaching, he immediately assumes the boy has betrayed him. As he is hurrying the boy down the cliff to the sea, the Borough knocks at the door. He panics. The boy screams as he slips and falls. Grimes climbs down after him. The men enter to find the hut deserted.<br>Act 3<br>Scene 1: Outside the Moot Hall, a few days later<br>In the Moot Hall a dance is in full swing. Outside, Auntie’s ‘nieces’ manage to escape the attentions of the lecherous Mr Swallow, who retires defeated into the Boar. Mrs Sedley tells Ned Keene she has conclusive proof that Grimes has murdered his apprentice. Keene leaves her to her midnight ravings. Ellen and Balstrode appear, discussing Grimes’s disappearance. Mrs Sedley overhears that Ellen has found the boy’s sweater down by the shore. Ellen and Balstrode decide to try to find Grimes and help him. When they are gone, Mrs Sedley whips up the community against Grimes and a man-hunt begins.<br>Scene 2: Some hours later<br>Grimes is alone, tortured by the distant sound of the hunt, longing for escape and peace. Ellen and Balstrode find him, and Balstrode helps him push his boat out to sea for the last time. Day breaks and the Borough goes about its business. Far out at sea a boat is sinking.

This was the second opera I watched and, following Peter Grimes, I was not at all expecting a good show. I was correct.
Honestly had no clue what was going on but violetta dies of cringe at the end.
For some reason she had to leave?
Youyou had me explain the parts he missed when he went on his little toilet Reddit break but honestly the whole show was just nothing. I suppose the music was kind of boppy though.

at least it's not Peter Grimes

## Plot as I understood it

Violetta host a party where she meets with Germont who has been in love with her for a long time. Germont confesses to her and she rejects him, only to completely change her mind 30 seconds later.
Flash forward to a while later (maybe a year?) and Violetta and Germont are living together far away from the city. Germont finds out that they'd been living off Violetta's money this entire time so he runs off to the city to grab some money to sustain his lavish lifestyle. Whilst bro is gone, his father pops over to tell Violetta to break up with Germont so that Germont's sister can get married. I don't know why this has to happen but I'm also not of nobility - it's not like he was going to marry his sister after all.
Anyway, Violetta agrees with the father and writes a letter for Germont before leaving to the city.
Flash forward again and Violetta is at a party flirting with some guy (pretty sure that's her job now that I think about it, which would potentially impact the family's image and thus the daughter's marriage but maybe I'm reading way too much into it) and Germont finds her. Germont chucks a bunch of money he know has at her to try to win her over again, but Violetta is not having any of it because she's got a promise to keep, so she lies and says she has a new man.
Flash forward again and Germont finds out that she's been giving him the cold shoulder because of her promise with his dad. Violetta however has giga cancer and is going to die real soon, so she doesn't even know if she can meet him again. He shows up and they share some romantic moment together. Violetta then dies of cringe.


> [!example]- Actual Plot
> Act I: Paris<br> Violetta, a courtesan of renown desire, is hosting a lavish party with the upper-class gentlemen of Paris and her fellow courtesans, all funded by her admiring patron, Baron Douphol. Amidst the champagne, she is introduced to a middle-class gentleman, Alfredo Germont, who has been in love with her for over a year – since, we learn, her illness began. Alfredo is pressured to make a toast in which Violetta joins him, urging everyone to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of life. As the guests retire to other rooms, Violetta suddenly grows ill. While left alone with Violetta, Alfredo protests his love – which she discourages at first, but then accepts in a sudden reversal. As dawn breaks, the gentlemen must all go home, and Violetta is left alone to contemplate the idea of having a true love for herself. Instead, she resolves to plunge herself headlong into the vortex of hollow pleasures that make up her existence.<br>Act II<br>Scene 1: A house in the country, three months later<br> Violetta and Alfredo are now living together in the idyllic countryside. When Alfredo learns from her servant Annina that Violetta has sold her possessions to support the life they lead, he returns to the city to raise the necessary funds. In his absence, Violetta receives an unexpected visit from Alfredo’s father. He begs her to end their relationship, otherwise his daughter’s marriage into a respectable family will be threatened. After a relentless breakdown of her character, Violetta agrees to sacrifice her love – despite it breaking her will to live. Germont leaves and Violetta writes a farewell note to Alfredo: she will return to the city and Douphol’s patronage. Alfredo returns, and Violetta arranges for him to be given the note after she has gone. When he reads it, he refuses the consolation of his father (who has been watching from nearby), and rushes back to the city to avenge himself.<br>Scene 2: Paris, that same night<br> A party is in progress, enlivened by a masque of gypsies and bullfighters. Alfredo appears alone and witnesses Violetta on the arm of Douphol. The two men play an aggressive round of cards which Alfredo wins. When she has an opportunity, Violetta speaks to Alfredo alone and begs him to leave and avoid a deadly fight with Douphol; pressed by Alfredo, she maintains her promise to Alfredo’s father and tells Alfredo that she loves Douphol. In a fury, Alfredo summons the guests to witness the repayment of his debts as he flings his winnings at her. Germont enters in time to witness his son’s outburst and shames him. Alfredo must leave the party – and Violetta.<br>Act III: Violetta’s bedroom, a few months later<br> The doctor tells Annina that her mistress will soon die. Violetta instructs Annina to give what little money they have left to the poor, and re-reads a letter from Germont telling her that Alfredo now knows of her sacrifice and is returning to beg her forgiveness. She believes it is now too late for a reunion with Alfredo. She bids farewell to all her hopes and prays to be released from this suffering. The sounds of a carnival in the street summon false hopes of Alfredo’s return. Then, to her astonishment, Alfredo returns to hold his beloved. Germont arrives to give his blessing, full of remorse at the pain he has caused. But it is too late.<br>

We booked this one because we recognised the name. I hadn't actually read the book before going in, but Youyou had.
Went to the national portrait gallery beforehand and then had some free* udon noodles from Marugame (the food was very fishy and not nice). Throughout the day, I kept smoking those sugar sticks which was lovely.
The ending of this opera was rather rushed.

## Plot as I understood it

Starts off in the "present day" which is some 200 years in the future where the USA does not exist. We are going through some cassette tapes left behind by Offred from 21st Century Republic of Gilead, where women have no rights and are basically just living wombs.
Offred is sent to a new posting and she meets the wife of the commander who is actually some famous superstar from back when we were in the USA. Offred meets someone called Nick who has the hots for her and she meets the rest of her cranky crew.
She has to visit the hospital with one of the pregnant handmaids and the Doctor offers to impregnate her because "no one will know it's my child" - he's just a horny little fellow. Somehow, she manages to refuse without being assaulted.
The commander then privately meets up with Offred, which is mega sus and illegal, since he's also in love with her and they have sex. Someone gives birth, then back to sex.
Commander is more open about his feelings for Offred during the baby-making sessions, which terrifies Offred because she could get in a lot of trouble if the wife found out that it was more than just impregnation to him. The lady who gave birth is killed for some reason + there's a rebellion movement called Mayday.
The wife then tells Offred that, if Offred gets pregnant, she could find out more about the child she had before the Republic was formed - she just needs to get pregnant with Nick's child.
Commander takes Offred out on an illegal date to a brothel, and then that night she has sex with Nick. The wife finds out about this and now there's a manhunt for Offred, so she tries to escape with Nick, but we never find out what happened to her next.


> [!example]- Actual Plot
> OUR PRESENT<br> We attend the Symposium Prologue 2195 AD.<br> International Historical Association Twelfth Symposium on the Republic of Gilead (formerly the United States of America).<br> Today’s keynote lecture: A recently discovered Gilead diary ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ recorded on period audio cassettes.<br> Today’s keynote speaker: Professor Pieixoto<br> Professor Pieixoto of Cambridge University introduces to us a recently discovered audio diary, recorded by an unnamed Handmaid in hiding. Playing the first tape, we hear her telling her tale…<br> In the early years of 21st-century America, appalled by widespread physical, moral and spiritual pollution – and, above all, by the low birth-rate caused by the climate crisis – right-wing fundamentalists have assassinated the President and members of the Congress and installed their own Bible-based dictatorship known as the Republic of Gilead. They have denied women the right to work or possess property, to read or write. Furthermore, all women of child-bearing age living in sin or second marriages are forcibly separated from their families and sent off to indoctrination centres, run by ‘Aunts’. There, the women become Handmaids, to be posted to selected privileged childless households and ritually impregnated by the husband in the presence of his wife.<br> Our Handmaiden has been torn from her husband Luke (it was his second marriage) and their five-year-old daughter and taken to the Red Centre.<br>THE HANDMAID’S PRESENT<br>The Red Centre Prelude<br> Classes are run by Aunt Lydia. Our Handmaid’s friend, Moira, is dragged back after a failed escape attempt. Another woman, Janine, breaks down and thinks she’s back working in a diner again. Moira escapes a second time. The Handmaids graduate.<br>Act I<br> Our Handmaid, who has not yet borne a child for Gilead, transfers to her next posting where she is known as Offred (Of Fred) after the Commander of the house. She recognises his wife as Serena Joy, who was a famous gospel singer in the time before Gilead. She meets the staff members of the household: Nick, a chauffeur, and Rita, a Martha or housekeeper. Memories of her life before Gilead when she met Luke, fell in love, and had a daughter invade Offred’s mind. Her Mother warned her of the dangers to come and she recalls the downfall of Congress and the riots as martial law was established.<br> Offred goes shopping paired with another Handmaid, Ofglen. They meet Janine, now called Ofwarren, who is heavily pregnant. When Offred visits the doctor, he offers to impregnate her. She declines, fearfully. At home, the chauffeur Nick attempts to talk to Offred, and the Commander enters her bedroom – both are illegal acts. Offred undergoes her monthly ritual impregnation. Afterwards, Nick tells her the Commander wants to see her privately, which is strictly forbidden.<br> The following day, all the Wives and Handmaids from the district meet at the Red Centre to witness the birth of Ofwarren’s baby. Offred begins to hallucinate that her past life is happening before her eyes. Back home, Offred visits the Commander in his office at night.<br> Interval of 20 minutes<br>Act II<br> Next morning, Rita finds Offred lying motionless and overreacts. The Commander caresses Offred during the next ritual impregnation, and she is terrified Serena Joy will notice and she will be sent to the Colonies for hard labour until she dies. Offred and Ofglen go prayer-shopping and discover they are both rebels. Ofglen reveals that there is an underground movement whose sign is Mayday. Ofwarren, whose baby turned out to be very ill and was euthanised, is beyond help. Guards take her away to be killed.<br> Offred’s night visits to the Commander continue. He explains things: why Rita overreacted, for instance – the previous Handmaiden killed herself.<br> Desperate for a child, Serena Joy secretly bribes Offred to try getting pregnant by Nick. The bribe is a photo of Offred’s missing daughter. Offred reluctantly agrees. The Commander smuggles Offred into Jezebel’s, a private brothel for top-ranking men in Gilead. She meets Moira there.<br> Back home, Offred and Nick make love.<br> Wives and Handmaids gather to witness the hanging of ‘criminals’. The Handmaids are allowed to destroy a ‘rapist’. Ofglen starts by kicking him unconscious to spare him pain – he was, in fact, a fellow member of the underground movement.<br> That afternoon, Offred finds she has a new shopping partner; she never again meets Ofglen. She has killed herself rather than be exposed as part of the resistance. Serena Joy has learned about Offred’s affair with the Commander. The secret police, known as the Eyes of God, arrive to arrest Offred. Nick offers her a way to escape but what fate will she go to?<br> Epilogue 2195 AD<br> Professor Pieixoto tells us that the ultimate fate of Offred and the men in her life is unknown.<br>

First opera with Jesse, so we went for a super short one. I don't recall how long it was but it was around one hour long compared with the previous 2-3 hour long ones I had seen with Youyou.
We went out on a trip to some maze - the Swatch exhibition at 188 The Strand, which wasn't the best, before stopping at a café for some lunch (some delicious hot chocolate).

## Plot as I understood it

Judith is getting married to Duke Bluebeard, who has had a bunch of wives in the past, all of whom have died of strange circumstances. The castle is all dark because all the windows are closed and the lights are off, so Judith asks him to open the windows and doors to let the sunlight in. Duke Bluebeard tells her no.
Silly Bluebeard can't say no to her for long though so he tells her to love him unconditionally and begins to open the doors.
Door 1 is a torture chamber, door 2 has weapons, door 3 has jewelerry, door 4 has something nice(?), door 5 is also nice.
They pour a bunch of wine on the table, symbolising the castle being stained with blood.
Door 6 is a lake of tears, which makes Judith accuse Bluebeard of having murdered his former wives. But she doesn't realise how much of a gigachad Bluebeard really is.
He hands her the keys to the final door, where we see all his former wives living extravagantly - they are his wives of dawn, midday, and dusk. Bluebeard asks Judith to be his wife of the night. She says no, but then walks through the door for whatever reason and gets trapped with the rest of the wives. Fade to black.


> [!example]- Actual Plot
> Judith and Bluebeard arrive at his castle, which is all dark. Bluebeard asks Judith if she wants to stay and even offers her an opportunity to leave, but she decides to stay. Judith insists that all the doors be opened, to allow light to enter into the forbidding interior, insisting further that her demands are based on her love for Bluebeard. Bluebeard refuses, saying that there are private places not to be explored by others, and asking Judith to love him but ask no questions. Judith persists, and eventually prevails over his resistance.<br>The first door opens to reveal a torture chamber, stained with blood. Repelled, but then intrigued, Judith pushes on. Behind the second door is a storehouse of weapons, and behind the third a storehouse of riches. Bluebeard urges her on. Behind the fourth door is a secret garden of great beauty; behind the fifth, a window onto Bluebeard's vast kingdom. All is now sunlit, but blood has stained the riches, watered the garden, and grim clouds throw blood-red shadows over Bluebeard's kingdom.<br>Bluebeard pleads with her to stop: the castle is as bright as it can get, and will not get any brighter, but Judith refuses to be stopped after coming this far, and opens the penultimate sixth door, as a shadow passes over the castle. This is the first room that has not been somehow stained with blood; a silent silvery lake is all that lies within, "a lake of tears". Bluebeard begs Judith to simply love him, and ask no more questions. The last door must be shut forever. But she persists, asking him about his former wives, and then accusing him of having murdered them, suggesting that their blood was the blood everywhere, that their tears were those that filled the lake, and that their bodies lie behind the last door. At this, Bluebeard hands over the last key.<br>Behind the door are Bluebeard's three former wives, but still alive, dressed in crowns and jewellery. They emerge silently, and Bluebeard, overcome with emotion, prostrates himself before them and praises each in turn (as his wives of dawn, midday and dusk), finally turning to Judith and beginning to praise her as his fourth wife (of the night). She is horrified and begs him to stop, but it is too late. He dresses her in the jewellery they wear, which she finds exceedingly heavy. Her head drooping under the weight, she follows the other wives along a beam of moonlight through the seventh door. It closes behind her, and Bluebeard is left alone as all fades to total darkness.
