This was the first opera I ever watched and quite frankly I don't understand why I decided to give opera a second try after this. The main character dies off screen sailing away as though he were Iggle Piggle and his personality is completely irredeemable.
The only funny thing of note was when he hit the woman he wanted to marry.
In fact, this opera was so boring that the people seated near me disappeared in between acts never to return.
At least the cafe with Youyou was nice (I am so fat).

## Plot as I understood it

Peter Grimes' first apprentice dies at sea due to mysterious circumstances and then some guy tells him he's got a new apprentice for Grimes. The naval officer tells Grimes to not get a new apprentice because he's probably going to die, but Peter Grimes gets one anyway. Pathetic fallacy - there's a storm that night and things happen. Here, we find out that Peter Grimes wants to marry Ellen and become rich.
A few days later, Ellen notices the apprentice has a bruise on his neck and refuses to say anything about it. She tells Peter Grimes to give the child a day off, but he refuses and then hits her, which the whole town finds out about.
Peter Grimes gets his apprentice to climb down the cliff (which had been destroyed by the storm earlier) but lets go off the rope holding the apprentice when some inspectors come to his door - he assumes the apprentice betrayed him but did not intend to kill him. He runs away.
The village says they have proof Peter Grimes killed his apprentices and there's a manhunt for him. Peter Grimes sails away and dies off screen.


> [!example]- Actual Plot
> Prologue<br>A boy apprenticed to the fisherman Peter Grimes has died at sea. An inquest is being held to determine the cause of death. After hearing Grimes’s testimony, the coroner, Mr Swallow, finds that the boy died in ‘accidental circumstances’. He warns Grimes not to get another apprentice. Grimes demands a full trial and the right to employ another boy. His pleas are ignored and the court is cleared. Ellen Orford, the local schoolteacher, assures Peter that with her help the future will be better.<br>Act 1<br>Scene 1: Morning<br>The Borough goes about its business. Grimes returns from fishing; only Captain Balstrode, a retired naval officer, and Ned Keene, the local apothecary, are willing to help bring in his boat. Keene tells Grimes he has arranged for a new apprentice from the workhouse. The carter, Hobson, at first refuses to fetch the boy, but consents when Ellen offers to look after the child on the journey. As a storm brews, Balstrode tries to dissuade Grimes from a course he fears will result in another tragedy, but Grimes is determined to get rich, marry Ellen and thus silence the Borough gossips.<br>Scene 2: The Boar<br>Late that night, the storm has reached hurricane force. To the annoyance of Auntie, the landlady, Mrs Sedley arrives to wait for Ned Keene. He has promised to meet her there with a new supply of laudanum. Auntie’s ‘nieces’ enter The Boar and fail to escape the advances of Balstrode and Bob Boles, the Methodist preacher. At the height of the storm, Ned Keene enters with news that the cliff by Grimes’s hut has been washed away. He is followed by Grimes himself: it is as if the eye of the storm has entered the room. Ellen and the new apprentice arrive, soaked and exhausted from their journey; before the boy can rest, Grimes insists on taking him straight home. He drags him off into the night.<br>Act 2<br>Scene 1: Sunday morning<br>Ellen is sitting on the beach with John, the new apprentice, while the church service begins. She encourages the boy to talk about himself, but he says nothing. Only then does she notice the bruising on his neck and immediately fears the worst. Grimes comes to take the boy off fishing. Ellen pleads for the boy’s right for a day of rest. When Peter refuses, she tells him that their attempt to make a new start has failed. Peter, in a frenzy, hits out at her and rushes off with the boy. This scene has been witnessed, and when the congregation comes out of church there is a call for action against Grimes. The men set out for his hut. Auntie, Ellen and the ‘nieces’ are left alone to reflect on the hopelessness of loving men.<br>Scene 2: Grimes’s hut<br>Grimes orders the boy to get ready for fishing. Haunted by the death of the last apprentice, he feels his dream of marrying Ellen slipping away. When he hears the men from the Borough approaching, he immediately assumes the boy has betrayed him. As he is hurrying the boy down the cliff to the sea, the Borough knocks at the door. He panics. The boy screams as he slips and falls. Grimes climbs down after him. The men enter to find the hut deserted.<br>Act 3<br>Scene 1: Outside the Moot Hall, a few days later<br>In the Moot Hall a dance is in full swing. Outside, Auntie’s ‘nieces’ manage to escape the attentions of the lecherous Mr Swallow, who retires defeated into the Boar. Mrs Sedley tells Ned Keene she has conclusive proof that Grimes has murdered his apprentice. Keene leaves her to her midnight ravings. Ellen and Balstrode appear, discussing Grimes’s disappearance. Mrs Sedley overhears that Ellen has found the boy’s sweater down by the shore. Ellen and Balstrode decide to try to find Grimes and help him. When they are gone, Mrs Sedley whips up the community against Grimes and a man-hunt begins.<br>Scene 2: Some hours later<br>Grimes is alone, tortured by the distant sound of the hunt, longing for escape and peace. Ellen and Balstrode find him, and Balstrode helps him push his boat out to sea for the last time. Day breaks and the Borough goes about its business. Far out at sea a boat is sinking.

## Plot as I understood it


> [!example]- Actual Plot
> Act I: Paris<br> Violetta, a courtesan of renown desire, is hosting a lavish party with the upper-class gentlemen of Paris and her fellow courtesans, all funded by her admiring patron, Baron Douphol. Amidst the champagne, she is introduced to a middle-class gentleman, Alfredo Germont, who has been in love with her for over a year – since, we learn, her illness began. Alfredo is pressured to make a toast in which Violetta joins him, urging everyone to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of life. As the guests retire to other rooms, Violetta suddenly grows ill. While left alone with Violetta, Alfredo protests his love – which she discourages at first, but then accepts in a sudden reversal. As dawn breaks, the gentlemen must all go home, and Violetta is left alone to contemplate the idea of having a true love for herself. Instead, she resolves to plunge herself headlong into the vortex of hollow pleasures that make up her existence.<br>Act II<br>Scene 1: A house in the country, three months later<br> Violetta and Alfredo are now living together in the idyllic countryside. When Alfredo learns from her servant Annina that Violetta has sold her possessions to support the life they lead, he returns to the city to raise the necessary funds. In his absence, Violetta receives an unexpected visit from Alfredo’s father. He begs her to end their relationship, otherwise his daughter’s marriage into a respectable family will be threatened. After a relentless breakdown of her character, Violetta agrees to sacrifice her love – despite it breaking her will to live. Germont leaves and Violetta writes a farewell note to Alfredo: she will return to the city and Douphol’s patronage. Alfredo returns, and Violetta arranges for him to be given the note after she has gone. When he reads it, he refuses the consolation of his father (who has been watching from nearby), and rushes back to the city to avenge himself.<br>Scene 2: Paris, that same night<br> A party is in progress, enlivened by a masque of gypsies and bullfighters. Alfredo appears alone and witnesses Violetta on the arm of Douphol. The two men play an aggressive round of cards which Alfredo wins. When she has an opportunity, Violetta speaks to Alfredo alone and begs him to leave and avoid a deadly fight with Douphol; pressed by Alfredo, she maintains her promise to Alfredo’s father and tells Alfredo that she loves Douphol. In a fury, Alfredo summons the guests to witness the repayment of his debts as he flings his winnings at her. Germont enters in time to witness his son’s outburst and shames him. Alfredo must leave the party – and Violetta.<br>Act III: Violetta’s bedroom, a few months later<br> The doctor tells Annina that her mistress will soon die. Violetta instructs Annina to give what little money they have left to the poor, and re-reads a letter from Germont telling her that Alfredo now knows of her sacrifice and is returning to beg her forgiveness. She believes it is now too late for a reunion with Alfredo. She bids farewell to all her hopes and prays to be released from this suffering. The sounds of a carnival in the street summon false hopes of Alfredo’s return. Then, to her astonishment, Alfredo returns to hold his beloved. Germont arrives to give his blessing, full of remorse at the pain he has caused. But it is too late.<br>

> [!example]- Actual Plot
> OUR PRESENT<br> We attend the Symposium Prologue 2195 AD.<br> International Historical Association Twelfth Symposium on the Republic of Gilead (formerly the United States of America).<br> Today’s keynote lecture: A recently discovered Gilead diary ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ recorded on period audio cassettes.<br> Today’s keynote speaker: Professor Pieixoto<br> Professor Pieixoto of Cambridge University introduces to us a recently discovered audio diary, recorded by an unnamed Handmaid in hiding. Playing the first tape, we hear her telling her tale…<br> In the early years of 21st-century America, appalled by widespread physical, moral and spiritual pollution – and, above all, by the low birth-rate caused by the climate crisis – right-wing fundamentalists have assassinated the President and members of the Congress and installed their own Bible-based dictatorship known as the Republic of Gilead. They have denied women the right to work or possess property, to read or write. Furthermore, all women of child-bearing age living in sin or second marriages are forcibly separated from their families and sent off to indoctrination centres, run by ‘Aunts’. There, the women become Handmaids, to be posted to selected privileged childless households and ritually impregnated by the husband in the presence of his wife.<br> Our Handmaiden has been torn from her husband Luke (it was his second marriage) and their five-year-old daughter and taken to the Red Centre.<br>THE HANDMAID’S PRESENT<br>The Red Centre Prelude<br> Classes are run by Aunt Lydia. Our Handmaid’s friend, Moira, is dragged back after a failed escape attempt. Another woman, Janine, breaks down and thinks she’s back working in a diner again. Moira escapes a second time. The Handmaids graduate.<br>Act I<br> Our Handmaid, who has not yet borne a child for Gilead, transfers to her next posting where she is known as Offred (Of Fred) after the Commander of the house. She recognises his wife as Serena Joy, who was a famous gospel singer in the time before Gilead. She meets the staff members of the household: Nick, a chauffeur, and Rita, a Martha or housekeeper. Memories of her life before Gilead when she met Luke, fell in love, and had a daughter invade Offred’s mind. Her Mother warned her of the dangers to come and she recalls the downfall of Congress and the riots as martial law was established.<br> Offred goes shopping paired with another Handmaid, Ofglen. They meet Janine, now called Ofwarren, who is heavily pregnant. When Offred visits the doctor, he offers to impregnate her. She declines, fearfully. At home, the chauffeur Nick attempts to talk to Offred, and the Commander enters her bedroom – both are illegal acts. Offred undergoes her monthly ritual impregnation. Afterwards, Nick tells her the Commander wants to see her privately, which is strictly forbidden.<br> The following day, all the Wives and Handmaids from the district meet at the Red Centre to witness the birth of Ofwarren’s baby. Offred begins to hallucinate that her past life is happening before her eyes. Back home, Offred visits the Commander in his office at night.<br> Interval of 20 minutes<br>Act II<br> Next morning, Rita finds Offred lying motionless and overreacts. The Commander caresses Offred during the next ritual impregnation, and she is terrified Serena Joy will notice and she will be sent to the Colonies for hard labour until she dies. Offred and Ofglen go prayer-shopping and discover they are both rebels. Ofglen reveals that there is an underground movement whose sign is Mayday. Ofwarren, whose baby turned out to be very ill and was euthanised, is beyond help. Guards take her away to be killed.<br> Offred’s night visits to the Commander continue. He explains things: why Rita overreacted, for instance – the previous Handmaiden killed herself.<br> Desperate for a child, Serena Joy secretly bribes Offred to try getting pregnant by Nick. The bribe is a photo of Offred’s missing daughter. Offred reluctantly agrees. The Commander smuggles Offred into Jezebel’s, a private brothel for top-ranking men in Gilead. She meets Moira there.<br> Back home, Offred and Nick make love.<br> Wives and Handmaids gather to witness the hanging of ‘criminals’. The Handmaids are allowed to destroy a ‘rapist’. Ofglen starts by kicking him unconscious to spare him pain – he was, in fact, a fellow member of the underground movement.<br> That afternoon, Offred finds she has a new shopping partner; she never again meets Ofglen. She has killed herself rather than be exposed as part of the resistance. Serena Joy has learned about Offred’s affair with the Commander. The secret police, known as the Eyes of God, arrive to arrest Offred. Nick offers her a way to escape but what fate will she go to?<br> Epilogue 2195 AD<br> Professor Pieixoto tells us that the ultimate fate of Offred and the men in her life is unknown.<br>
