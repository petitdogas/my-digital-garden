# What is this website?

It's my Digital Garden - a set of notes I maintain about all aspects of my life and studies. Find out [how this site is built](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/). 

# How do I read these notes?

All notes have tags #example which can be clicked to view every single note with said tag. Use âŒ˜+K to search through the website using these tags or the names of each page.

Notes are interconnected - there is a web showing which notes are linked to which, though this is mostly just for visuals rather than navigation.

This website works exactly like how Wikipedia would - there are backlinks and hyperlinks to take you from page to page.
