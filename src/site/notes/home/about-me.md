I'm Omar Ullah, a first year student at Bart's Medical School. I'm interested in languages - ancient and modern, technology, and visiting the [[Entertainment/Theatre and Opera/opera\|opera]] and [[Entertainment/Theatre and Opera/theatre\|theatre]].

Currently, I speak both English (L1) and German (B1-2) though my German may be a bit rusty depending on when you're reading this.

Please [[home/contact-me\|contact me]] for any and all questions. I'd love to hear from you.
