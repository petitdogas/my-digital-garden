me too
is that how you knew colonel mustard works in westminster? was he one of your clients?
i was asking miss scarlet
haha! so it is true!
wadsworth here is right. i am a homosexual. i feel no personal shame or guilt about all this, but i must keep it a secret or else i will lose my job on security grounds
[walk to mustard]
even though that's ridiculous because homosexuality is not a choice, but, rather, a genetic predisposition
thank you!
[blow kiss to audience, walk to sofa, sneeze, sit down]
locked!?
this is ridiculous you can't lock us in here i have plants to feed
<span style="color:rgb(255, 64, 184)">how do you do</span>

[lean over to look at the evidence]
<span style="color:rgb(255, 64, 184)">we are all <span style="color:rgb(255, 64, 184)">goners</span></span>
we must find that evidence and destroy it!

# Scene 7 
[tiptoe towards door, gasp in shock and jump onto wadsworth]
no
<span style="color:rgb(255, 64, 184)">look what happened to the cook!</span> 
colonel are you willing to take that chance?
i suppose you're right
[sneeze]

good evening officer, we've been expecting you

well, actually, yes
yes yes yes
of course you may, sir. there's a phone in the lounge
ah of course my mistake you can use the phone in the study

[near towards door]
sounds like a telephone is off the hook
[follow wadsworth]
<span style="color:rgb(255, 64, 184)">maybe we can escape through the window</span>

<span style="color:rgb(255, 64, 184)">but one of us wasn't there!</span> 
<span style="color:rgb(255, 64, 184)">who?</span> 
mrs peacock!
when we heard yvette scream, we all ran from the study. but you - you lagged behind
"i'm in an aggravated state of shock"
it was the perfect time to commit MURDER
may i?
IT WAS MRS PEACOCK IN THE KITCHEN WITH THE DAGGER
i found your feather in the freezer, mrs peacock. and it was your dagger that stabbed the cook in the back
<span style="color:rgb(255, 64, 184)">then we ran to the kitchen</span> 
[stand next to wadsworth]
<span style="color:rgb(255, 64, 184)">IT WAS MR GREEN IN THE BILLIARD ROOM WITH THE LEAD PIPE</span>
preposterous!
<span style="color:rgb(255, 64, 184)">so you bashed his brains out</span> 
don't be ridiculous! i can't stand the sight of blood. it wasn't me!
[run to front and be in a huddle]
<span style="color:rgb(255, 64, 184)">the motorist who got killed in the lounge</span> 
but who killed him? the door was locked.
<span style="color:rgb(255, 64, 184)">ding dong and the cop arrived</span> 
[move to stage left]
the cop who got killed in the library

mrs white?
[V - be at wing]
[raise arm with lead pipe when called]
<span style="color:rgb(255, 64, 184)">accent change</span> 
you're mr boddy!
murder?
but the police will be here any minute. you'll never get away with this
<span style="color:rgb(255, 64, 184)">one plus... shut up! anybody who moves is gonna get it </span> 
so you're going to keep blackmailing us and we'll pretend that this never happened? that's the plan?
i'll tell you why not
larry goodman mi6
<span style="color:rgb(255, 64, 184)">ushers unlock th-</span> 
quit talking to the audience wadsworth or should i call you mr boddy. the jig is up
that's right - the real mr green got a letter just like the rest of you, only he came to mi6 to ask for help. i'm an agent out of the hartford office who's apparently a deadringer for green. i took his place tonight so we could have a sting operation

they had to use me because the real mr boddy here knew what green actually looks like. i usually work the hartford desk for property crime - you know, theft, fraud and the like

i've become a bit of an expert on the art of pickpocketing - that's how this large envelope marked confidential ended up with me tonight and not any of you

it's all here - we all had our suspicions of what we might find here, but I never imagined it to be this rich

# SCARLET
let's all take a look shall we. here's ms scarlet's accounting book, including client names and dates of service proving she is one of westminster's highest grossing madams. and giving plenty of motivation as to why she killed the cop who's listed right here on her payroll

# Plum
then we have this love letter addressed to professor plum
seems that singing telegram girl was the underage daughter of the head of the ministry of social and behavioural sciences. looks like she was just about to come clean to daddy - who most certainly would have cleaned out professor plum. guess that's why you killed her

# Colonel
and these negatives. my oh my colonel! you were quite the regular at miss scarlet's establishment. guess you wouldn't have got to keep your important military title if your old driver, that unfortunate poor motorist who stopped by the house tonight, had informed your major general where he drove you every tuesday night

talk, huh? that's a very democratic way to put it

# Peacock
and poor mrs peacock - here's your bible.
made it pretty easy to stash your cash for bribery, no? too bad your old cook couldn't keep her mouth shut, huh? if only she hadn't told boddy your secrets, maybe she'd still be alive today

# White
and mrs white, you really weren't lying, were you? you really did hate yvette

and here's a container holding your fingerprints collected at the crime scenes of your previous murders.
fingerprints which i'm sure mi6 will be able to match to the noose tied around yvette's neck

you mean these?

# Wadsworth
and last, but certainly not least, mr bobby boddy

i hold in my hand an mi6 file on the whole big boddy family. your butler wadsworth had been feeding us information for quite some time - i can see why you killed him. your shot missed him in the study, but he wisely played dead. awfully good actor. had us all convinced. but while we were all racing from the kitchen with the cook, you found your sneaky butler trying to make his escape by the bathroom and bludgeoned him to death with the lead pipe i'd dropped on the hallway floor whilst running to the kitchen

and you left him, dead, in the bathroom, propped up against the door, for poor mrs peacock to encounter moments later

the boddy family has been wanted for generations for organised crime, blackmail, and murder. but they've always eluded the law - until now. tonight, the boddy family business has reached a dead end

<span style="color:rgb(255, 64, 184)">you leave my family out of this</span> 
[draw gun as strobes and jump onto sofa]
<span style="color:rgb(255, 64, 184)">wadsworth dies fr this time</span> 
i tell ya, this was the most exciting night i've had in a long time. and now - you're all under arrest
BOYS
here are the criminals you've been looking for. and here's all the evidence against them. oh, and there are some tapes in the billiard room you might find useful as well.

they all did! but if you want to know who killed mr boddy, i did. in the hall. with the revolver. okay chief, take them away - i'm going to go home and sleep with my wife

[end play]
