# CT scans (computerised tomography)
- multiple X-ray beams
- builds up a cross section of the body's organs and tissues
![anatomy imaging-20241030123638105.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/anatomy%20imaging-20241030123638105.png)

## advantages
- cross-sectional images allow for reconstruction of a 3D image
- good high-contrast bone detail
- well tolerated
- readily available
## disadvantages
- ionising radiation dose
- metallic artefacts cause loss of detail
- soft tissue surrounded by bone difficult to image
- respiratory movement artefact

# MRI scan (magnetic resonance imaging)
- uses non-ionising radiation
- very high soft tissue contrast
- can get both structural and functional information

## T1 - normal anatomy
- in the brain it gives good grey/white matter contrast (fat - white = myelin, yellow bone marrow etc)
## T2 - pathology
- sensitive to water content of tissue
- inflammation or [[Medical School/Year 1/cr/week 2/microcirculation and oedema#Oedema\|oedema]] in damaged tissue means higher water content


</div></div>

## Contraindication
- older models of cardiac pacemakers
- aneurysm clips
- shrapnel
	- particularly in or around the eyes
- cochlear implants
- neurostimulators
- early pregnancy (first trimester)
- metallic foreign body away from vital organ/major vessel
## Avascular Necrosis

# Ultrasound
- uses sound waves (no radiation)
- cheap and readily available
- difficult to interpret
- portable and real-time, so can look at movement
![anatomy imaging-20250121144834999.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/anatomy%20imaging-20250121144834999.webp)
- ultrasounds guide steroid injections, nerve blocks, aspiration
## Dopper Ultrasound
- uses ultrasound to look at blood flow in arteries and veins
![anatomy imaging-20250121145014652.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/anatomy%20imaging-20250121145014652.webp)
- red to yellow is flow towards transducer
- blue to green is flow away from transducer
