# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Analyse the causes and consequences of abnormal gait
- [ ] Describe the changes of moving from a double to a single support
- [ ] Describe the events in the normal walking cycle
- [ ] Understand the actions of the main muscle groups of the lower limb in the walking cycle

# Lower Limb and Posture
- support and locomotion
- hip and knee are stable in extension and knee locks passively
	- little muscle needed to maintain upright posture
	- some activity in calf muscles - most of the body weight is in front of the ankle joint
## Posture
![walking and posture-20250121111226319.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%203/attachments/walking%20and%20posture-20250121111226319.webp)
- 1) weight of upper body transmitted centrally down vertebral column
- 2 and 3) ilium transfers weight to femurs
- 4) pubic rami form struts or braces that maintain integrity of arch
- diagonal angle of femurs re-centres support directly under the body
	- bipedal standing and walking is more efficient
	- bodyweight when standing on one leg is not too lateral (so you don't tilt)
### Normal Posture
- standing at rest, feet slightly apart
- hip and knee extended
- centre of pressure is
	- in front of ankle
	- just in front of knee
	- just behind hip
	- just behind ear
### Standing on one leg
- muscles around hip of supporting leg become active to
	- move body weight over supporting leg
		- hip adductors
	- prevent pelvis from dropping on unsupported side
		- hip abductors

#### Pelvis drop
- hip abductors weak
- fracture of neck of femur or greater trochanter
- dislocation of femoral head
#### Trendelenburg's Sign
- tests gluteus medius and minimus (hip abductors)

# Walking
![walking and posture-20250121113249217.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%203/attachments/walking%20and%20posture-20250121113249217.webp)
- divided into strides
	- which are divided into stance and swing
## Stance Phase
![walking and posture-20250121113133374.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%203/attachments/walking%20and%20posture-20250121113133374.webp)
### Initial Contact (heel strike)
- foot inverted and dorsiflexed as heel makes contact on lateral side
### Loading Response (flat foot)
- ankle rocker action begins
- foot brought into full contact with the ground
### Midstance
- bodyweight brought over to the planted foot
### Terminal Stance (heel off)
- heel lifted off the ground
- foot everted and plantarflexed
- bodyweight advances ahead of single-supporting foot
### Preswing (toe off)
- lower limb positioned to quickly swing forward beneath body
- transfer of weight from one limb to other
## Swing Phase
![walking and posture-20250121113241122.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%203/attachments/walking%20and%20posture-20250121113241122.webp)
### Initial Swing
- foot pushed off ground, limb accelerates forward
### Midswing
- limb moves beneath body until tibia of leg is vertical
- foot dorsiflexed to prevent toes dragging on ground
### Terminal Swing
- limb decelerates forward movement, prepares for initial contact again
## Muscle Groups used in Walking
### Stance Phase
#### Heel Strike to Flat Foot
- dorsiflexors active at heel strike
- gluteus maximus and hamstrings extend hip early in stance
- quadriceps extend knee early in stance
- hip abductors active when going from double to single support
![walking and posture-20250121113707600.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%203/attachments/walking%20and%20posture-20250121113707600.webp)
#### Midstance to Toe Off
- plantar flexors active at toe off to power forward thrust
- hip flexors and knee extensors start to prepare to lift leg
![walking and posture-20250121114034748.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%203/attachments/walking%20and%20posture-20250121114034748.webp)
### Swing phase
- hip flexors help lift leg off ground
- thigh momentum checked by hip extensors at end of swing
	- gluteus maximus
- hamstrings flex the knee, lifting leg off ground
- dorsi flexors active throughout to prevent toe dragging

# Gait Analysis
- balance
- co-ordination
- walking rhythm
- change of speed/direction
- stride length
# Gait Problems
- caused by mechanical and neurological
	- osteoarthiritis, muscle strains, blisters
	- perception deficits, nerve damage
## Shuffling Gait - Parkinsonian Gait
- short, shuffling steps
- rigidity in hip and knee extensors
- stooped forward posture
- arm swing reduced
- turning is rigid like a statue

## Scissor Gait - Spastic Gait
- can be unilateral (stroke or cerebral palsy) or bilateral (cerebral palsy)
- thigh swings across body during swing phase
- difficulty in putting heel on ground
	- toe walking
	- unstable
## High Stepping Gait
- dorsi flexor paralysis = foot drop
	- unless leg if lifted higher by exaggerated knee bend
- whole foot tends to slap onto ground rather than heel strike
![](https://i.makeagif.com/media/11-17-2015/L_XU3j.gif)
## Staccato Gait
- plantar flexor paralysis so no forward thrust
- unaffected limb never advances beyond affected limb
## Quadriceps Paralysed
- knee can only be stabilised by being locked in full extension by bending trunk forward or holding knee back with one hand
	- compensation by iliacus and pectineus for hip flextion (the adductors for knee extension)
