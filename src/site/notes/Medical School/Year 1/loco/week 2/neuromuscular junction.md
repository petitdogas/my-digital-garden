# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Describe the process of synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction
- [ ] Draw the major structural features of the neuromuscular junction
- [ ] Describe the mechanism of action of major drugs that act at the neuromuscular junction
- [ ] Describe the pathology and medical uses of botulinum toxin, and the pathophysiology of myasthenia gravis

# Small and Large Motor Units
## Small motor units
- fine, precise movements
	- e.g. in hands and extraocular muscles
- few muscle fibres (10-100 per motor neurone)
- activated at low force
## Large motor units
- gross, powerful movements
	- e.g. quadriceps and gluteus maximus
- many muscle fibres (1000+ per motor neurone)
- activated at high force

# Transmission of impulse across the NMJ

## Presynaptic
### Vesicle Docking and Acetylcholine Release - SNARE complex
- calcium entry switches on synaptotagmin
	- lowers the activation energy for bilayer-bilayer fusion
		- vesicles fuse with membrane - exocytosis of acetylcholine
### Recycling: Clathrin-coated Vesicles
- after release of acetylcholine, empty vesicles are coated with clathrin
- clathrin-coated vesicles move back into synaptic terminal cytoplasm
	- vesicles are refilled with acetylcholine
- recycling is important because otherwise we'd be out of acetylcholine to release within about 1000 action potentials

## Postsynaptic
![neuromuscular junction-20250115122906133.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%202/attachments/neuromuscular%20junction-20250115122906133.webp)
### EPP Generation
- nicotinic receptors activation allows Na<sup>+</sup>  to enter the muscle fibre
	- creating the End Plate Potential (EPP)
### Threshold Reached
- EPP is large enough to depolarise the membrane
	- voltage-gated sodium channels open
### Action Potential
- triggers a full action potential, which propagates along the muscle fibre
	- travels down T-tubules
		- release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from sarcoplasmic reticulum
			- binds to troponin --> muscle contraction
## Acetylcholine Breakdown
![neuromuscular junction-20250115122920265.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%202/attachments/neuromuscular%20junction-20250115122920265.webp)
- controlled by acetylcholinesterase and choline acetyl transferase

# Conditions affecting the NMJ
## Botulism
- caused by clostridium botulinum - anaerobic, spore-forming, motile so found in tinned food
- foodborne disease - ingestion of the toxin and the pathogen
	- infant botulism under 6 months is usually caused by spores found in honey
### SNARE complex dysfunction
![neuromuscular junction-20250115123230819.webp|764](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%202/attachments/neuromuscular%20junction-20250115123230819.webp)
- SNARE proteins are cleaved, so vesicle doesn't fuse to plasma membrane
	- causing paralysis
### Symptoms
- drooping eyelids
- double/blurred vision
- dry mouth
- slurred speech
- difficulty swallowing
- difficulty breathing
- weakness or paralysis of arms or legs
- nausea and vomiting
### Treatment
- BIG-IV
- supportive care â€“ respiratory, cardiovascular support
### Botox
- injected when involuntary, sustained/spasmodic patterned muscle activity
- increased muscle tone
- headaches and sweating
- cosmetic use
## Myasthenia gravis
- autoimmune condition where antibodies attack acetylcholine receptors at NMJ
	- EPP therefore not large enough to trigger muscle action potential
		- causes muscle weakness and fatigue
### Symptoms
- muscle weakness
	- especially in eyes, face, and limbs
		- ptosis, diplopia, mask-like face
- fatigue which worsens with activity
- dysphagia and dysarthria
- dyspnoea leading to respiratory failure
### Diagnosis
- antibodies to acetylcholine receptor, muscle-specific kinase and anti-striated antibodies
- electromyography
### Treatment
![neuromuscular junction-20250115124010950.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%202/attachments/neuromuscular%20junction-20250115124010950.webp)
- acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (pyridostigmine)
- immunosuppressors
- plasmapheresis for acute exacerbations or myasthenic crisis
- supportive care including respiratory support in emergencies, and physical therapy

# Drugs targeting the NMJ
## Agonists
- Carbachol - glaucoma
	- not absorbed well across the gut or through BBB
- Nicotine - more selective for ganglionic and CNS than neuromuscular junction
	- used for smoking cessation
## Depolarising Neuromuscular Blockers
- succinylcholine - acts as an agonist at NMJ
	- causes initial depolarisation and muscle contraction
		- which is then a sustained depolarisation - causes muscle paralysis
- used for tracheal intubation, surgical procedures requiring muscle relaxation, and electroconvulsive therapy
### Side Effects
- malignant hyperthermia
- hyperkalaemia
- bradycardia
- muscle pain
- increased intraocular pressure
### Contraindications
- neuromuscular diseases
- glaucoma
- conditions where potassium imbalance is expected
## Inhibitors
### Reversible
- physotigmine, neostigmine, pyridostigmine
- reversing the effects of non-depolarising neuromuscular blockers in surgery
- used in myasthenia gravis, glaucoma, Alzheimer's disease
### Irreversible
- bind to acetylcholinesterase, forming a permanent inhibition until new enzymes are synthesised
- organophosphates (e.g. sarin, tabun, parathion, malathion)
- nerve agents like sarin and VX (highly toxic chemical weapons)
- pesticides such as parathion and malathion
# Symptoms and treatment of AChE inhibitor poisoning
## Symptoms
- miosis
- severe dyspnoea
- seizures
- cardiovascular collapse (overstimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system)
- death due to resp. failure and asphyxiation
## Treatment
- atropine muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist
	- to counteract symptoms like bradycardia, bronchoconstriction, and excessive secretions
- pralidoxime - reactivator of acetylcholinesterase
- diazepam or other anticonvulsants
