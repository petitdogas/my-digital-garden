# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Recap the muscles of the thigh
- [ ] Understand the function of the bursae around the knee joint
- [ ] Describe the extra-capsular and intra-capsular ligaments of the knee joint
- [ ] Be able to describe the structures that pass through the popliteal region
- [ ] Understand the arrangement of the bones and their osteological features that make up the knee joint

# Popliteal Fossa

# Popliteus
- weak flexor of the knee
- unlocks the knee by laterally rotating the femur
	- (closed-chain movement)
- unlocks the knee by medially rotating the tibia
	- (open-chain movement)
- initiates the subsequent actions of the hamstrings to flex the knee

# Knee Joint Complex
- consists of patellofemoral joint (saddle) and two tibiofemoral joints (condyloid)
- all articulations share the same joint capsule
- stability determined by ligaments and tendons
- hinge synovial joint
## Q Angle (alignment of the knee)
- difference between mechanical axis and anatomical axis
	- mechanical axis is a straight line from the centre of the head of the femur to the medial malleolus
	- anatomical axis is a straight line from the centre of the head of the femur to the 
- ~17° in females, <12° in males (when standing)
- genu valgum (larger Q), genu varum (smaller Q)

# Collateral Ligaments
- taut when the knee is flexed
- medial collateral ligament is bigger than lateral collateral ligament
# Cruciate Ligaments
## Anterior Cruciate Ligament
- posterior part of femur to the anterior aspect of the tibia
- attaches to lateral condyle
## Posterior Cruciate Ligament
- anterior part of femur to posterior aspect of the tibia
- attaches to medial condyle
## Drawer Tests
- push tibia forwards/backwards against a fixed femur
- tests for anterior/posterior dislocation of knee
	- torn ACL = goes very anterior
	- torn PCL = goes very posterior

# Menisci
- plates of fibrocartilage
- help to deepen the joint and act as shock absorbers
- bear weight, support articulating surfaces of the tibia and femur
- guide rotation between the tibia and femur
- stabilise translation of the joint

# Patellar Reflex
- tests the integrity of the femoral nerve and the spinal nerves L3-4
- tendon hammer to hit patellar tendon
	- causes involuntary movement

# Bursae
- most are extensions of the knee synovial cavity
	- filled with synovial fluid
- act as cushions against friction and rubbing of tendons, ligaments, and bones around the knee joint
- suprapatella bursae, prepatella bursae, deep infrapatella bursae, superficial infrapatella bursae
	- since synovial fluid, can be inflamed - bursitis
