# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Be able to describe the course of the major arteries in the lower limb
- [ ] Be able to describe the course of nerves in the lower limb
- [ ] Describe the formation of the lumbar and sacral plexi
- [ ] Be able to identify where arterial pulsations may be felt in the lower limb
- [ ] Know the functional problems arising from damage to nerves in the lower limb and the lumbar and sacral plexi

# Arteries
common iliac artery -> internal iliac artery -> inferior/superior gluteal artery (above and below piriformis) + obturator artery (through obturator foramen towards medial compartment of the thigh)

common iliac artery -> external iliac artery -> femoral artery (found at mid-inguinal point) -> profunda femoris -> lateral circumflex femoral artery
femoral artery passes through the adductor hiatus â€“ popliteal artery -> posterior tibial artery -> through the tarsal tunnel behind the medial malleolus to reach the sole of the foot (posterior tibial pulse) -> medial and lateral plantar arteries
popliteal artery -> anterior tibial artery -> through the interosseous membrane to become dorsalis pedis artery (pulse lateral to extensor hallucis longus tendon)

# Femoral Triangle

- lateral to medial
	- nerve then artery then vein

# Veins of the Leg

- small saphenous vein drains into popliteal
- great saphenous vein drains into femoral vein
- veins in the leg and feet are at greater risk of becoming varicose
	- standing and walking upright increases the pressure in the veins of your lower body

# Dermatomes

- all lower limb nerve supply from lumbar or sacral regions
	- lumbar down anterior
	- sacral down posterior
- L3 - over the knee
- L4 - down to the floor
- L5 - big toe
- stand on S1, lie on S2, sit on S3, wipe S4

# Lumbosacral Plexus
## Lumbar plexus
### femoral nerve L2-L4
- anterior compartment of the thigh
	- quadriceps, knee extension, hip flexion (kicking region)
#### femoral nerve palsy
![neurovascular supply to the lower limbs-20250115113110815.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%202/attachments/neurovascular%20supply%20to%20the%20lower%20limbs-20250115113110815.webp)
- caused by compression from treatment for congenital hip dysplasia
- caused by pelvic fractures
- caused by anterior hip dislocations (very rare)
- paralysis of quadriceps (instability of the knee)
- sensory loss in anterior thigh and medial leg
### obturator (L2-L4)
- medial compartment of thigh
	- hip adductors (adductor magnus, adductor longus, adductor brevis, gracilis)
### lateral cutaneous nerve (L2-L3)
- purely sensory
- innervates lateral skin region of the thigh
## Sacral plexus
### sciatic nerve (L5-S2)
- innervates posterior compartment of thigh
	- hamstrings - knee flexion
- splits into tibial and common peroneal nerves
	- tibial nerve innervates deep and superficial posterior compartments of the leg
		- plantarflexion, flexion of digits
	- common peroneal nerve splits into superficial and deep peroneal nerves
		- wraps around neck of the fibula
		- deep peroneal nerve innervates anterior compartment of the leg
			- dorsiflexion and extension of digits
			- sensation between first and second digits of the toe
		- superficial peroneal nerve innervates lateral compartment of the leg
			- evert the ankle
			- sensation in the rest of the toes
#### tibial nerve palsy
- caused by facture of tibia or compression in tarsal tunnel (ankle)
- causes paralysis in the plantar flexors and sensory loss in the back of leg and sole of foot
#### sciatic nerve inury
- caused by posterior hip dislocations
- foot drop
- wasting of hamstrings, calf muscles, and dorsiflexors
- loss of Achilles reflex
### superior gluteal nerve
- above piriformis
- innervates gluteus medius and minimus
	- hip adduction and stabilisation
### inferior gluteal nerve
- below piriformis
- innervates gluteus maximus
	- hip extension and lateral rotation
