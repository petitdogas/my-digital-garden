# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Understand the structure of skeletal muscle
- [ ] Understand the physiology of the skeletal muscle fibre
- [ ] To describe how the muscle fibre contracts

# Types of Movement
## isotonic concentric
- muscle contraction where the muscle shortens as it generates force
	- e.g. lifting a dumbbell during a bicep curl
## isotonic eccentric
- muscle lengthens under tension, controlling the descent of a load or resisting gravity
	- e.g. lowering the dumbbell back down during a bicep curl
## isometric
- muscle contraction occurs without any visible change in muscle length
	- holding a plank
- no movement of joints

# Myotendinous Junctions
- junction of muscles with tendons: cells become highly tapered/ridged
- collagen fibres insert deeply into these ends
	- become continuous with the endomysial collagen matrix
- smaller tendinous portions come together to form whole tendon
- in skeletal muscle: myofilaments inserted into sarcolemma
	- force is transmitted to the collagen of ECM, tendon.

# Muscle Organisation Levels
## Skeletal Muscle
- surrounded by epimysium
- contains muscle fascicles
## Muscle Fascicle
- surrounded by perimysium
- contains muscle fibres
## Muscle Fibre
- surrounded by endomysium
- contains myofibrils
- multinucleated
- sarcolemma - plasma membrane
- sarcoplasm - contains myoglobin to store oxygen
- muscle proteins - arranged into sarcomeres
- actin, myosin, tropomyosin, troponin, titin, dystrophin, accessory proteins
## Myofibril
- surrounded by sarcoplasmic reticulum
- consists of sarcomeres
# Muscle Contraction
## Sliding Filament Theory

# Motor Unit
- alpha motor neurone and all the muscle fibres supplied = [[Medical School/Year 1/loco/week 2/neuromuscular junction#Small and Large Motor Units\|motor unit]]
	- when this neurone fires, all innervated muscle fibres contract
		- allows for graded contraction

# Muscle Adaptations
## Endurance Exercises
- increase in proportion of slow-twitch muscle
- increased mitochondrial density
- enhanced aerobic enzyme activity
	- citrate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase
- enhanced fat metabolism
- reduced glycolytic activity - less lactate
- greater glycogen storage in the muscle
## Resistance Exercises
- increased muscle protein synthesis - muscle growth
- improved insulin sensitivity
- increased glycogen storage
- overall increase in resting metabolic rate

# Types of Muscle Fibre
## Type I
- slow contraction time
- red due to myoglobin
- sustained force
- fuel is triglycerides
- high mitochondrial density
## Type II
- fast contraction time
- white due to absence of myoglobin
- sudden movement
- fuel is ATP
- low mitochondrial density
