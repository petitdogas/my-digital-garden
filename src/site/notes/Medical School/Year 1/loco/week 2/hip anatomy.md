# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Describe the hip joint and the functional anatomy that provides it with stability
- [ ] Know the movements possible at the hip joint and the muscles that produce these movement
- [ ] Understand the arrangement of the pelvic girdle in relation to the hip joint
- [ ] Understand the clinical relevance of the hip joint

# Bones
## innominate bones
- the hip bones / pelvic bones
- left and right
- articulate posteriorly with the sacrum via the sacroiliac joints
- articulate anteriorly at the pubic symphysis

### ilium
![hip anatomy-20250113091022734.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%202/attachments/hip%20anatomy-20250113091022734.webp)
- hands on hips = resting hands on iliac crest
	- anterior most point has the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS)
		- inferior is harder to palpate and not as prominent
	- posterior most point has the posterior superior iliac spine
### pubis
![hip anatomy-20250113091223640.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%202/attachments/hip%20anatomy-20250113091223640.webp)
- V-shaped bone - superior pubic ramus and inferior pubic ramus
- obturator foramen
### ischium
![hip anatomy-20250113091403810.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%202/attachments/hip%20anatomy-20250113091403810.webp)
- ischial tuberosity and ischial spine
	- ischial tuberosity is the bum bone - we sit on it
- acetabulum
## sacrum
- made of five vertebrae fused together (S1-5)
- sacral spinal cords leave vertebral column via anterior intervertebral foramen
### sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments
![hip anatomy-20250113091852687.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%202/attachments/hip%20anatomy-20250113091852687.webp)
- prevent the lower end of the sacrum from being rotated upward at the sacroiliac joint
## coccyx
- below the sacrum
- does not articulate - no weight distributed

# The Hip Joint
![hip anatomy-20250113092940940.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%202/attachments/hip%20anatomy-20250113092940940.webp)
- ball and socket join
- articulation between femoral head and acetabulum
- wide range of movement
- very deep socket - much more stable joint
## ligaments
- pubo-femoral ligament
- ilio-femoral ligament
	- biggest and strongest
- ischio-femoral ligament
![hip anatomy-20250113092459783.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%202/attachments/hip%20anatomy-20250113092459783.webp)
- ligaments are stronger anteriorly and joint weakest in flexion
## interior structures
![hip anatomy-20250113092608275.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%202/attachments/hip%20anatomy-20250113092608275.webp)
## hip dislocation
- posterior dislocations are more common
- often comes with a fracture to the acetabulum

# Blood Supply to the Hip
- femoral artery --> deep artery of the thigh (profunda femoris) --> medial and lateral circumflex femoral arteries
![hip anatomy-20250113093318932.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%202/attachments/hip%20anatomy-20250113093318932.webp)
![hip anatomy-20250113093337931.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%202/attachments/hip%20anatomy-20250113093337931.webp)
- retinacular arteries responsible for at least 80% of blood supply to femoral head and neck
## intracapsular fracture
- higher chance of developing [[Medical School/Year 1/loco/week 3/imaging soft tissue#Avascular Necrosis\|avascular necrosis]] at the femoral head
	- joint replacement - more complicated to recover from
![hip anatomy-20250113093611041.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%202/attachments/hip%20anatomy-20250113093611041.webp)
## extracapsular fracture
![hip anatomy-20250113093601345.webp|632](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%202/attachments/hip%20anatomy-20250113093601345.webp)

# Muscles at the Hip Joint
![hip anatomy-20250113094109807.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%202/attachments/hip%20anatomy-20250113094109807.webp)
## gluteus maximus
- major extensor and lateral rotator of hip
- muscle fibres insert into iliotibial tract
## gluteus medius and minimus
- abductors of hip
- stabilisation of hip during locomotion
- damage to gluteus medius, minimus or the nerve that supplies them leads to contralateral hip drop
## piriformis and the lateral rotators
- lateral rotators of hip
## tensor fascia lata
## iliopsoas
- anterior
- major hip flexor
- consists of psoas major and iliacus
## pectineus
- flexes the hip
## muscle groups in the thigh
### anterior compartment
- quadraceps
- hip flexion
- knee extension
- femoral nerve
### medial compartment
- adductor magnus
- hip adduction
- obturator nerve
### posterior compartment
- hamstrings
- hip extension
- knee flexion
- sciatic nerve
