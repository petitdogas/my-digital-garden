# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Describe the ligaments of the ankle joint and the associated bones
- [ ] Identify the movements of the foot/ankle and its responsible muscles
- [ ] Describe some of the lesions of the muscles to the ankle foot
- [ ] Identify the intrinsic muscles of the foot
- [ ] Identify the arches of the foot and describe what anomalies to the arches look like

# Ankle Joint Complex
- distal tibiofibular joint
- talocrural joint
- subtalar joint
- dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, eversion, inversion

## Stability of the Ankle
- talus is wider anteriorly
- ankle more stable in dorsiflexion than plantarflexion
	- the talus glides rotates upward towards the wider surface
- medial malleolus is shorter than lateral malleolus
	- more stable in eversion than inversion

# Ligaments in the Ankle
- deltoid ligament: medial malleolus to navicular and calcaneus
	- stabilises ankle during eversion
- posterior talofibular ligament
- anterior talofibular ligament
- calcaneofibular ligament
## Sprained Ankle
- often caused by inversion
- stretch or tear in the ligaments
- inflammatory process
	- oedema and bruising

# Movements of the Foot
- inversion and eversion (via joints)
	- talus articulates with calcaneus and navicular
		- lesion of this joint restricts lower limb locomotion as a whole
- dorsiflexion and toe extension
	- anterior compartment muscles
		- tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus and extensor hallucis longus
	- deep fibular nerve
- eversion (via muscles)
	- lateral compartment mucsles
		- fibularis longus and fibularis brevis
	- superficial fibular nerve
- plantarflexion
	- superficial posterior leg compartment
		- plantaris soleus gastrocnemius
	- deep posterior leg compartment
		- popliteus, tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus, flexor hallucis longus
	- all the muscle insert onto calcaneus via the Achilles tendon

# Calcaneal Tendon Rupture
- positive Simmonds test suggests lesioned calcaneal tendon
	- unable to plantarflex

# Retinaculum
- extensor retinaculum is anterior
- flexor retinaculum is posterior
- functions to hold down tendons of flexors

# Arches of the Foot
![ankle and foot anatomy-20250117114656129.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%202/attachments/ankle%20and%20foot%20anatomy-20250117114656129.webp)
![ankle and foot anatomy-20250117114659227.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%202/attachments/ankle%20and%20foot%20anatomy-20250117114659227.webp)
- plantar vault is made up of a strong bond between 3 arches
	- medial longitudinal arch
		- tall arch results in medial side of foot missing from footprint
	- lateral longitudinal arch
		- resilient as the talus transmits a lot of the body weight across the lateral longitudinal arch
	- transverse arch
## Arch Types
- pes cavus
- pes planus
- neutral foot

## Maintenance of Longitudinal Arches

### dynamic support
- muscle tendons tendons that insert into apex of arches tend to increase their height
	- tibialis anterior
- tendons that run through the sole of foot
	- prevent separation
		- fibularis longus and small intrinsic muscles
### passive support
- shape of bones allows them to interlock
	- longitudinally arranged ligaments prevent separation

# Hallux Valgus (Bunions)
- movement of the 1st digit towards the 2nd digit
	- lateral pointing of the hallux
- 90% inherited, but can be due to improper footwear
