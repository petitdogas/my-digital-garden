# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Understand how the articular cartilage contributes to the function of synovial joints
- [ ] Understand the main biochemical components of synovial fluid
- [ ] Understand how glycosaminoglycans contribute to lubricating properties of the synovial joint
- [ ] Understand how synovial fluid is produced

# Synovial Membrane / Synovium
- 1-3 cells thick
- synoviocytes
	- type A - bone marrow derived macrophage for immune surveillance
	- type B - fibroblast-like connective tissue cell for proteoglycan production (majority)
- no basement membrane between synoviocytes and subintima
	- no barrier for fluid movement
	- subintima is loose connective tissue
		- [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 1/extracellular matrix and cell adhesion#Types of Collagen\|type II collagen]]
		- contains dense network [[Medical School/Year 1/cr/week 2/microcirculation and oedema#Fenestrated Capillaries\|fenestrated capillaries]]
			- endothelia have pores and capillaries are surrounded by basement membrane
- synovial fluid ultrafiltrate of blood with added hyaluronic acid

# Synovial Fluid
- seeps into articular cartilage
	- slippery weight-bearing film which reduces friction between cartilage
	- distributes force across joint surfaces
	- forms reserve volume
	- helps nourish articular cartilage (as it is avascular and aneural)
- small amount occupies all free spaces between articulating surfaces

- thixotropic
- water squeezed from articular cartilage when compressed
	- weeping lubrication
	- seeps back into cartilage at rest

## Hyaluronic Acid
- hyaluronic acid concentration increases as fluid squeezed from cartilage at comrpession
	- reacts with proteins and forms a tangled mass as a shock absorber
## Lubricin
- water soluble glycoprotein
	- produced by chondrocytes and synoviocytes
- forms thin superficial barrier
	- repels joint surfaces, preventing contact between articular surfaces

# Articular Cartilage
- caps ends of bones in synovial joints
- hyaline cartilage
	- type II cartilage
	- GAGs are negatively charged, attracting water in
		- shock absorption and nourishment
	- GAGs and proteoglycans form hydrated gel
## Role
- elastic, resilient shock absorber
- smooth, slippery, low coefficient of friction
- deeper layer merges with a calcified layer (tidemark) that attaches it to subchondral bone
## Layers

## Extracellular Matrix
- ECM made by chondrocytes
- 80% water
- 15% collagen (mostly type II)
	- make pockets that are filled with water binding proteoglycans complexes â€“ regulate compressibility
	- network of fibrils that give overall framework and shape of the cartilage
- 15% proteoglycans - attract water
- lacks blood and lymphatic vessels
	- hence the need for diffusion

# Glycosaminoglycans and Proteoglycans
- keratan sulphate and chondroitin sulphate
- in articular cartilage aggrecan is the major proteoglycan
- many aggrecan monomers then attach to hyaluronic acid via link proteins forming very large aggregates

## Aggrecan changes with age
- young - bigger and longer complexes
	- fill collagen pockets fully
	- more negative charge; more water attracted
- old - smaller and fewer side branches
	- gaps in collagen pockets
	- less negative charge; less water attracted
