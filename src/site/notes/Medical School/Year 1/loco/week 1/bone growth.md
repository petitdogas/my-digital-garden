# Long Bone Structure

# Types of Bone
![bone growth-20250110131438252.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%201/attachments/bone%20growth-20250110131438252.webp)
## Lamellar
- found in mature bones
- parallel layers / sheets of collagen
	- strong and dense
- slow development and result of bone remodelling
- provides mechanical strength and durability
### Compact bone (80%)
- cortical bone
- strong, dense, hard outer layer
### Cancellous bone (20% mass 80% surface area)
- trabecular bone
- spongey, inner layer of trabeculae
- light and less dense
- constantly modified to accommodate load

## Woven
- immature, soft, bendable
	- disorganised, with randomly oriented collagen fibres
- bone repair, fracture healing, foetal development
- temporary - later replaced with lamellar bone
	- scaffold for later bone remodelling and strengthening
	- contains more osteocytes than lamellar bone

# Bone Composition
- 35% organic
	- 28% [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 1/extracellular matrix and cell adhesion#Types of Collagen\|collagen]]
		- mainly type I
	- 5% proteoglycans / glycoproteins (compressive strength + calcium binding)
		- and bone promoting growth factors
- 60% inorganic
	- 95% calcium hydroxyapatite
- approx. 5% water

# Osteon (Haversian System)
![bone growth-20250110122436353.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%201/attachments/bone%20growth-20250110122436353.webp)
![bone growth-20250110122443292.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%201/attachments/bone%20growth-20250110122443292.webp)
## Haversian Canal
- central canal running longitudinally through the osteon
- contains blood vessels and nerves, providing nutrients and removing waste from bone cells
## Lamellae
- concentric rings of bone matrix surrounding the Haversian canal
- composed of collagen fibres and mineralised matrix
	- give the bone its strength
## Lacunae
- small spaces between lamellae
	- house osteocytes
## Osteocytes
- mature bone cells located within lacunae, connected to each other via tiny channels called canaliculi
## Canaliculi
- microscopic channels radiating from the lacunae
- allow communication and nutrient/waste exchange between osteocytes and the Haversian canal
## Cement Line
- outer boundary of each osteon, separating it from neighbouring osteons
# Bone Cells
## Osteoprogenitor
- mesenchymal cells which maintain the cell population in bone
- respond to signals such as mechanical stress, growth factors, and injury
	- differentiate into osteoblasts
- located in the medullary cavity and periosteum of bone
- influenced by parathyroid hormone (PTH)
![bone growth-20250110122836741.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%201/attachments/bone%20growth-20250110122836741.webp)
## Osteoblast
- create new bone (osteoid)
- when surrounded by osteoid they become osteocytes
- interact with other bone cells, such as osteoclasts to regulate bone remodelling
- responds to PTH, calcitonin, and oestrogen
![bone growth-20250110122845346.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%201/attachments/bone%20growth-20250110122845346.webp)
## Osteocyte
- embedded within osteons
- maintain the bone in response to different demands
- canaliculi allow for communication between osteocytes
- sense mechanical stress and send signals to osteoblasts and osteoclasts
	- to regulate bone remodelling in response to stress
- regulate calcium and phosphate uptake/release from bone matrix
![bone growth-20250110122855208.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%201/attachments/bone%20growth-20250110122855208.webp)
## Osteoclast
- derived from monocytes
- break down bone to release calcium and remove damage
	- release calcium and phosphate into the bloodstream, contributing to calcium homeostasis.
- multinucleated

# Bone Development
## Intramembranous ossification
- flat bones of skull, mandible, part of clavicle
- mesenchymal cells condense and differentiate as osteogenic cells
	- osteoblasts
		- these then secrete bone matrix (osteocytes)
			- matrix becomes calcified
		- vascularisation of mesenchyme - osteoblasts require oxygen, so blood vessels grow
		- connective tissue surrounding the bone differentiates into the periosteum
![bone growth-20250110123404108.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%201/attachments/bone%20growth-20250110123404108.webp)
## Endochondral ossification
- mesenchyme condenses and differentiates as chondroblasts to create a hyaline cartilage model
	- perichondrium forms around this
		- as cartilage bone enlarges in size, chondrocytes towards the centre increase in size (hypertrophy) and die
			- forming small cavities for osteoblasts to move into
				- blood vessel growth as osteoblasts require oxygen
					- outer perichondrium changes to periosteum

# Bone Growth
- begins at 6 weeks of gestation
	- epiphyseal growth plate ossifies in early twenties
- Foetal skeleton: 275 bones
- Adult skeleton: 206 bones
