# Bone Cells
## Osteoprogenitor
- mesenchymal cells which maintain the cell population in bone
- respond to signals such as mechanical stress, growth factors, and injury
	- differentiate into osteoblasts
- located in the medullary cavity and periosteum of bone
- influenced by parathyroid hormone (PTH)

## Osteoblast
- create new bone (osteoid)
- when surrounded by osteoid they become osteocytes
- interact with other bone cells, such as osteoclasts to regulate bone remodelling
- responds to PTH, calcitonin, and oestrogen

## Osteocyte
- embedded within osteons
- maintain the bone in response to different demands
- canaliculi allow for communication between osteocytes
- sense mechanical stress and send signals to osteoblasts and osteoclasts
	- to regulate bone remodelling in response to stress
- regulate calcium and phosphate uptake/release from bone matrix

## Osteoclast
- derived from monocytes
- break down bone to release calcium and remove damage
	- release calcium and phosphate into the bloodstream, contributing to calcium homeostasis.
- multinucleated

# Bone Marrow
- red bone marrow at birth
	- haemopoietic stem cells
- epiphyses and diaphysis (medullary cavity) gradually contain yellow marrow (fat storage site, mostly adipocytes)
- red bone marrow remains in vertebrae, ribs, skull, pelvis and epiphyses of femur
- iliac crest is preferred for bone marrow transplantation

# Epiphyseal growth plate
## Resting Zone (Reserve Zone)
- nearest to the epiphysis, small, inactive chondrocytes (reservoir), structural support and anchors the plate to the bone
## Proliferative Zone
- chondrocytes divide rapidly, forming columns of flattened cells, producing new cartilage
## Hypertrophic Zone
- chondrocytes enlarge and prepare for calcification:
	- release enzymes and signalling molecules that initiate the mineralization of the surrounding cartilage matrix
## Calcification Zone
- cartilage matrix begins to calcify, creating a hardened scaffold
	- chondrocytes die due to the calcification, leaving behind cavities
## Ossification Zone (Zone of Bone Deposition)
- closest to the diaphysis of the bone
- blood vessels and osteoprogenitor cells invade the cavities left by the dying chondrocytes
	- osteoblasts deposit bone matrix on the calcified cartilage scaffold, forming new bone

# Bone Remodelling
![basic bone metabolism-20250110133449794.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%201/attachments/basic%20bone%20metabolism-20250110133449794.webp)
- renews bone before deterioration
- redistributes bone matrix along lines of mechanical stress
- trabecular bone 3-10 times quicker than cortical bone
	- larger surface area
		- responds to stresses on the bone quicker

## Internal Stimuli
- physical stress on the bone is sensed by network of cannuliculi
	- leads to increased osteoblast activity
## External Stimuli
- proinflammatory [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 9/cytokines\|cytokines]] increase osteoclast activity
	- IL-1, IL-6, IL-17 and TNF
- low serum calcium leads to release of parathyroid hormone (PTH)
## Hormones
### PTH / Vitamin D axis
- low serum calcium results in release of PTH from parathyroid gland
	- increases Ca2+ reabsorption from the kidney (at expense of phosphate excretion) - short term
	- promotes the activation of vitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the kidney - intermediate term
		- active vitamin D increases Ca2+ absorption from gut
	- increases number and activity of osteoclasts - long term

### Calcitonin
-  released from C-cells in parafollicular region of thyroid gland
- acts to reduce Ca2+ serum
	- weaker than PTH and Vitamin D
		- second line treatment for osteoporosis
	- inhibits osteoclast differentiation, activity and motility
	- increases Ca2+ excretion from kidney
	- increases bone mineralisation
	- inhibits Ca2+ absorption by intestines
### Oestrogen
- gut - increased Ca2+ absorption
- bone - decreased resorption
### Progesterone
- stimulates osteoblasts and inhibits osteoclasts
### Glucocorticoids
- gut - decreased Ca2+ absorption
- bone - increased resorption
