# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Describe the course of the major arteries of the upper limb
- [ ] Identify positions where arterial pulses may be felt
- [ ] Describe the formation of the brachial plexus
- [ ] Explain briefly the most common nerve injuries to the upper limb

subclavian artery --> axillary artery --> brachial artery --> birfurcates to radial and ulnar arteries --> palmar arches

# Brachial Plexus
- C5-T1

- roots trunks division cords branches
	- **reach to drink cold beer**
- musculocutaneous C5-C7
- axillary C5-C6
- median C5-T1
- radial C5-T1
- ulnar C8-T1
- **most alcoholics must really urinate**

## musculocutaneous nerve (C5-C7)
- supplies the flexor compartment of the arm
	- biceps brachialis
	- brachialis
	- coracobrachialis
- sensory fibres distal to the elbow provide sensory supply to skin on lateral surface of forearm
## axillary nerve (C5-C6)
- motor innervation to deltoid and teres minor
- sensory innervation to skin over the deltoid muscle
- vulnerable to shoulder dislocation
## median nerve (C5-T1)
- runs with the brachial artery (medial) and passes through the carpal tunnel to reach the hand, where it supplies the muscles of the thumb
- sensory for first 3.5 digits
## radial nerve (C5-T1)
- passes into posterior compartment of the arm
- runs in radial groove deep to triceps brachii
- innervates all of the muscles on the posterior aspect of arm and forearm
- sensory fibres innervate skin posterior aspect of the hand
## ulnar nerve (C8-T1)
- medially in the arm and posterior to medial epicondyle of the humerus
	- the tingly bit that hurts a bit üëç - funny bone
- innervates flexor carpi ulnaris and ulnar half of flexor digitorum profundus in the forearm
- ulnar nerve innervates most of the intrinsic muscles of the hand
- sensory innervation of skin over medial dorsal and plantar hand
	- digits 3.5-5

# Erb's Palsy
- superior cords of the brachial plexus damaged
- adducted shoulder, medially rotated arm, extended elbow
- usually due to difficult birth
- waiter's tip

# Klumpke Palsy
- injury to inferior roots less common than at superior roots
- affects small muscles of hands
	- claw hand results

## Thoracodorsal
- C6, C7, C8
- latissimus dorsi
## Suprascapular
- C5, C6
