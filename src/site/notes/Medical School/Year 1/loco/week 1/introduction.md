# Upper and Lower Compartments
## Upper
- anterior/posterior arm
- anterior/posterior forearm
## Lower
- three compartments in thigh (anterior, medial, posterior)
- four compartments in leg (anterior, lateral, superficial, deep)
# Compartment Syndrome
- swelling in a muscle compartment leads to pressure in the area
	- deep fascia isn't very stretchy, so pressure sort of stays in
		- compresses veins, arteries, nerves
			- causes ischaemia
			- can lead to permanent injury to muscle and nerves
- treat with fasciotomy
