# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Describe the bones and joints of the pectoral girdle
- [ ] Describe the glenohumeral joint

# Shoulder Joint and Pectoral Girdle
- pectoral girdle is an incomplete ring of bones attaching the shoulder joint to the axial skeleton
	- connected by clavicle, sternum, and scapula on each side
## Bones
### clavicle
- fracture of clavicle causes upper limb to drop with gravity
	- medial fragment pulled superiorly by the sternocleidomastoid
	- lateral fragment pulled medially by pectoralis major
		- therefore surgical intervention required to bring those fragments together for healing
### scapula
- coracoid process of scapula
### humerus
- anatomical neck under head
	- surgical neck is more prone to fracture
## Joints
### sternoclavicular joint
- between the manubrium and clavicle
- synovial
- saddle
- no muscle
- has an articular disc

- very strong ligaments - rarely see injury
- posterior dislocation can be life-threatening
###  acromioclavicular joint
- plane type of synovial joint
	- allows gliding movement
	- no muscles cross AC joint

### glenohumeral joint
- ball and socket joint
	- circumduction, flexion, extention, adduction, abduction
- the socket is the glenoid fossa of the scapula (smaller than the ball - the head of the humerus)
- not strong, but flexible
	- due to lax capsule

- most commonly dislocated joint in the body
	- usually anterior shoulder dislocation
- glenoid fossa is deepened by a fibrocatilaginous disc - glenoid labrum
	- this can tear
### scapulothoracic "joint"
- not a true anatomical joint
	- no cartilage and no fluid, but scapula can move freely along the back
- elevation/depression - superior/inferior movement
- scapula wraps around thorax anteriorly/posteriorly - protraction/retraction movement
- rotation around the back
- 1/3 of abduction of arm from scapulothoracic and 2/3 from glenohumeral

# Muscles of the Shoulder
## Trapezius
- from occipital bone of the skull, cervical and thoracic vertebrae to the spine fo the scapula and lateral end of the clavicle
![shoulder anatomy-20250106094342537.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%201/attachments/shoulder%20anatomy-20250106094342537.webp)
- innervated by CN - accessory nerve (XI)
## Latissimus dorsi
- wraps around thorax and inserts into humerus
- acts with teres major to extend, adduct, and medially rotate
## Teres Major
- acts with latissimus dorsi to extend, adduct, and medially rotate
## Rhomboids
![shoulder anatomy-20250106094528675.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%201/attachments/shoulder%20anatomy-20250106094528675.webp)
- bring about scapula retraction
## Levator scapulae
- brings about elevation of scapula
![shoulder anatomy-20250106094620790.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%201/attachments/shoulder%20anatomy-20250106094620790.webp)
## Serratus anterior
- originates from the medial border of the scapula and wraps underneath the scapula and inserts onto the ribs
- protraction of the scapula
- long thoracic nerve
![shoulder anatomy-20250106094718410.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/loco/week%201/attachments/shoulder%20anatomy-20250106094718410.webp)
## Pectoralis major
- adducts, medially rotates, flexes the shoulder
	- hugging muscle
- innervated by pectoral nerve
## Pectoralis minor
- stabilises the shoulder joint
- innervated by pectoral nerve
## Deltoid
- fan-shaped muscle wrapping around the shoulder
- has three heads
	- anterior, posterior, medial
- innervated by axillary nerve
## Rotator cuff muscles
- surround the glenohumeral joint and help support it

### supraspinatus
- abduction
### infraspinatus
- external rotation
### teres minor
- external rotation
### subscapularis
- internal rotation

# Compartments
