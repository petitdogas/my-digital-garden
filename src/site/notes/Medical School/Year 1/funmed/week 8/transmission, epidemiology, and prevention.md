# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Definitions - Epidemic, Pandemic, Incidence, Prevalence, Index case, Primary case, Secondary case, Tertiary case.
- [ ] How viruses are transmitted.
- [ ] Factors that influence virus transmission.
- [ ] Sites of viral entry - Skin, Respiratory Tract, Eyes, Mother to Child, Host response to infection.
- [ ] Infection control- Basic, Vaccines - Herd Immunity, RO number.

# Definitions
- epidemic - an increase in incidence of an infection over and above expected levels
- pandemic - epidemic spanning multiple countries
- endemic - constance presence of a disease in a specific area
- incidence - measure of the probability of an infection
	- incidence rate is the number of new cases per population at risk in a given time period
- prevalence - proportion of people infected
- index - the first case identified

# Transmission and Spread of Viruses
- airborne (Chickenpox, Influenza, Measles and SARS-CoV-2)
- droplet (Influenza, adenoviruses, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus)
- direct (Herpes, pox)
- oral (Epstein-Barr, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes)
- insect vectors (Zika)
- blood borne (HIV, HTLV, HepB, Ebola)
- mother-to-child (HIV, HTLV)
- sexual transmission (HIV, Herpes, HepB)

## Droplets
- a variety of sizes which can travel different distances
- aerosols can linger in the air in a specific place for a long period of time
	- and therefore build up in poorly ventilated regions
		- long and short range inhalation

| Droplets                       | Aerosols                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| produced by coughs and sneezes | produced during all expiratory activities |
| fall on fomites                | remain suspended in the air               |
| fall to the ground up to 2m    |                                           |

## Skin
- external impermeable layer of keratinocytes can be damaged e.g. cuts and bites
	- exposes live epithelial cells rich in capillaries
		- allows viruses to access a rich source of cells

## Respiratory Tract
- most common route
- goblet cells produce mucus to prevent viral particle attachment
- mucociliary escalator
	- ![transmission, epidemiology, and prevention-20241112121504422.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%208/attachments/transmission,%20epidemiology,%20and%20prevention-20241112121504422.png)
	- damage will lead to bacterial superinfection
- basement membrane is a physical barrier
- tissue fluids move viruses to the lymphatic system

## Mother-to-Child
- transplacental
	- breaks in the syncytial cell layer
	- targeting other cell types - cytotrophoblasts or extravillous trophoblasts
	- antibody-mediated transcytosis
- during childbirth
	- exposed to maternal blood, body fluids, and to the maternal genital tract without the placental barrier intervening
- breast feeding

# Infection Control
- wash hands regularly
- wear PPE
- disinfect surfaces with 1:10 bleach solution / EPA registered disinfectant

# Vaccinations
![transmission, epidemiology, and prevention-20241112121049749.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%208/attachments/transmission,%20epidemiology,%20and%20prevention-20241112121049749.png)
- herd immunity
	- indirect protection of unvaccinated persons brought about by the presence of immune individuals

## Herd Immunity Threshold
- R<sub>0</sub> = Average number of transmissions per case
	- therefore if R<sub>0</sub> < 1, infection dies out
		- if above 1, infection spreads
- 1/R<sub>0</sub> is the epidemic threshold
	- proportion of population susceptible to virus
		- therefore 1 - 1/R<sub>0</sub> people must be vaccinated to eliminate the virus
