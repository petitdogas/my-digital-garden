# Transmission and Spread of Viruses
- airborne (Chickenpox, Influenza, Measles and SARS-CoV-2)
- droplet (Influenza, adenoviruses, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus)
- direct (Herpes, pox)
- oral (Epstein-Barr, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes)
- insect vectors (Zika)
- blood borne (HIV, HTLV, HepB, Ebola)
- mother-to-child (HIV, HTLV)
- sexual transmission (HIV, Herpes, HepB)

## Droplets
- a variety of sizes which can travel different distances
- aerosols can linger in the air in a specific place for a long period of time
	- and therefore build up in poorly ventilated regions
		- long and short range inhalation

| Droplets                       | Aerosols                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| produced by coughs and sneezes | produced during all expiratory activities |
| fall on fomites                | remain suspended in the air               |
| fall to the ground up to 2m    |                                           |

## Skin
- external impermeable layer of keratinocytes can be damaged e.g. cuts and bites
	- exposes live epithelial cells rich in capillaries
		- allows viruses to access a rich source of cells

## Respiratory Tract
- most common route
- goblet cells produce mucus to prevent viral particle attachment
- mucociliary escalator
	- ![transmission, epidemiology, and prevention-20241112121504422.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%208/attachments/transmission,%20epidemiology,%20and%20prevention-20241112121504422.png)
	- damage will lead to bacterial superinfection
- basement membrane is a physical barrier
- tissue fluids move viruses to the lymphatic system

## Mother-to-Child
- transplacental
	- breaks in the syncytial cell layer
	- targeting other cell types - cytotrophoblasts or extravillous trophoblasts
	- antibody-mediated transcytosis
- during childbirth
	- exposed to maternal blood, body fluids, and to the maternal genital tract without the placental barrier intervening
- breast feeding

# Innate Immunity
- nonspecific physical/chemical/anatomical barriers to prevent colonisation of host by most bacterial pathogens
![how microbes cause disease-20241113110936858.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%208/attachments/how%20microbes%20cause%20disease-20241113110936858.png)

# Adherence
- pathogens express multiple adhesion factors
- adherence prevents early clearance from host, enabling competition with natural flora

## Major Adhesion Factors
- pili or fimbriae
	- hair-like structures made of proteins
- afimbril adhesin
	- membrane-anchored proteins interacting directly with host receptors
	- indirect interaction with host cell receptors via bridging molecule

## Biofilms in Adhesion
- community of bacteria that produce a sugar polymer, known as extrapolymeric substance (EPS) that allows the biofilm to attach to a surface
- extreme resistance to antibiotics and other anti-microbial agents
- high resistance to host immune cells
![how microbes cause disease-20241113111324098.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%208/attachments/how%20microbes%20cause%20disease-20241113111324098.png)

# Local Spread and Invasion
## Local Spread
- once on epithelium, can spread via the blood stream
- degradative enzymes called spreading facotrs
	- formation of lesions at site of colonisation and facilitate growth
	- do not kill host cells
		- hyaluronidase breaks down hyaluronic acid in connective tissue
		- collegenase 
## Invasion
### Trigger
- bacteria inject virulence factors into host cell cytoplasm
- bacteria weakly adhere to cell
- force the cell to engulf the bacterium
### Zipper
- pathogen surface protein has a high affinity with host cell transmembrane protein
- host cell envelops pathogen --> uptake of pathogen

## Evasion of Host Defences
### Prevention of Phagocytosis
- inhibit chemoattractants
- chemotaxis inhibitory protein antagonises C5aR
	- prevents neutrophil and monocyte response to C5a
- kill phagocytes
- capsules
- stealth - resemble self-proteins
### Survival within Phagocytes
- escape from phago/endosome and grow in cytoplasm
- inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion
- survive within phagolysosome (inhibition of reactive species)
- replicate within phagolysosome
### Destroying Antibodies
- IgA proteases cleave IgA
	- natural mucosal antibody which decreases rate of colonisation
## Survive Stress
- detoxification of oxygen derived harmful substances from the host
- superoxide dismutase (SOD) neutralise O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> free radicals

## Nutrients
- iron chelating agents have a high affinity for Fe
- iron is required for microorganism growth
# Immune Response
## Complement
![how microbes cause disease-20241113112854526.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%208/attachments/how%20microbes%20cause%20disease-20241113112854526.png)
- first part of the innate immune response
### opsonisation (C3b) and pathogen clearance by phagocytes
### MAC : membrane attack complex (C5b) and direct lysis of pathogens
### enhancing inflammation (C5a)
- activation and recruitment of phagocytic cells by anaphylatoxins (C5a, C3a) released by digestion of complements components

## Phagolysosome
- antimicrobials lysosomal enzymes: cationic peptides - α-defensins
- reactive oxygen species (ROS)
	- superoxide, hydrogen peroxide
- nitric oxide (NO)

# Microbial Toxins
## Endotoxins - Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)
- released when bacteria die
- toxic portion activates complement and stimulates production of cytokines
- results in septic shock (septicaemia)
	- fever and diffuse haemorrhage 
- LPS net effect is induction of fever inflammation, intravascular coagulation, which can lead to haemorrhage and endotoxic shock
## Exotoxins
- released from live bacteria
- 3 main types
	- cytolysins with cell membrane targets
	- bipartite A-B toxins: intracellular targets
	- toxins acting on host defences (superantigens)

### A-B exotoxins
- two subunits - A and B
	- A is active domain (enzymatic activity)
	- B is binding domain (allows translocation of A into cytoplasm)
#### Cholera Toxin
- ADP ribosylates large G proteins which regulate cAMP
	- upregulation of cAMP
		- stimulates chloride ions secretion via cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel
			- water and other electrolytes osmotically follow which cause diarrhea
![how microbes cause disease-20241113113929981.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%208/attachments/how%20microbes%20cause%20disease-20241113113929981.png)

### Superantigens
- superantigens induce non-specific class II MHC – T-cell receptor binding.
	- causes widespread non-specific stimulation of T-cells.
		- excessive cytokine release, systemic
			- leads to fever, vomiting, diarrhoea and circulation / organs failure and death
