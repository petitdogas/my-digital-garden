# Learning Objectives
- [ ] To start to describe the alterations in cell physiology that collectively result in malignant growth.  
- [ ] Understand the disrupted life cycle of a cancer cell.  
- [ ] Define an oncogene and tumour suppressor gene (and give examples).  
- [ ] Describe the role of gain of function mutations in oncogenes and loss of function mutations in tumour suppressor genes in cancer initiation and progression.

# Physiology of Cancer Cells
??
- growth signals not required for growth and survival
- unresponsiveness to growth-inhibitory signals
- evasion of apoptosis
- defects in DNA repair
- cells become immortal
- ability to metastasise
- sustained and increased angiogenesis

# Proto-oncogenes
- tightly regulated control of proto-oncogenes
- encode proteins which control cell growth, differentiation, and inhibition of apoptosis
## Mutated proto-oncogenes
- known as oncogenes
- dominantly activated gene gains function
	- increase in function e.g. signalling for cell division

### Types of Mutations
- Growth factors (signalling proteins)
	- rarer
- Receptors (e.g. tyrosine kinase receptors)
	- more common
- Intracellular signalling proteins (e.g. kinases)
- Transcription factors
- Anti-apoptotic proteins

# Tumour Suppressor Genes
when switched on:
??
- controlling (restricting) cell cycle and cell division
- inducing apoptosis in cells carrying mutations when other mechanisms have failed e.g. DNA repair
- encode proteins inhibiting cell growth

## Gate Keepers
- checkpoint genes
- cell division regulator genes
- control apoptosis

### p53-dependent transcriptional regulation
??
- transcription factor increasing the expression of p21 (CDKI)
	- upregulation of p21 inhibits cell from entering S phase
		- inhibits CDK2 in G1
			- mutated TP53 will bypass this
Rb unphosphorylated fosters RB-E2F complex which stops cell cycle progression
- if mutation in p53 (TP53), Rb is phosphorylated (deactivated)
	- so RB-E2F complex not produced
		- so cell progresses through cell cycle with mutated DNA

## Caretakers
- maintains genetic stability
- DNA repair


## Mutations in Tumour Suppressor Genes
- act recessively to release cells from growth control
- increases probability of mutations in the other class of genes
- allows division of cells which contain mutations
