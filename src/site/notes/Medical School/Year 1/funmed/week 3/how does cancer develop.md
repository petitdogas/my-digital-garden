# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Recognise tumour development is a multi-step process
- [ ] Describe the histogenic origins of tumours
- [ ] Give a classification of benign and malignant tumours based on origin of cell and morphological features
- [ ] Identify and compare the features between benign and malignant neoplasms

# Carcinogenesis
![how does cancer develop-20241009122503527.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%203/attachments/how%20does%20cancer%20develop-20241009122503527.png)

# Carcinomas
## Covering and Lining Epithelia (squamous cell carcinoma)
- stratified squamous cells
## Glandular Epithelia (adenocarcinoma)
- simple cuboidal and simple columnar
- all breast carcinomas arise from the epithelial cells in the terminal duct lobular unit

# Differences Between Benign and Malignant Tumours

| Benign Tumours (not cancer)       | Malignant Tumours (cancer)       |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| slow growing                      | fast irregular growth            |
| encapsulated, usually oval-shaped | non-encapsulated irregular shape |
| well differentiated               | poorly differentiated            |
| low mitotic rate                  | high mitotic rate                |
| basement membrane not reached     | basement membrane reached        |
| not metastasising                 | metastasising                    |

# Tumour Classification

- Differentiation state
	1. Epithelial
	2. Mesenchymal
	3. Mixed
- Embryonic origin
	1. Ectoderm
	2. Endoderm
	3. Mesoderm
- Biological behaviour
	1. Benign
	2. Malignant

## Benign
- name of cell origin  +  morphological character + oma
	- lipoma, fibroma, osteoma, chondroma
		- if glandular, adenoma
		- if stratified squamous, papilloma
## Malignant
- name of origin of cell + morphological character + sarcoma/carcinoma
	- sarcoma if mesenchymal 
	- carcinoma if epithelial

> [!NOTE]+ not all omas are benign
> Hematopoietic --> Leukaemia/lymphoma/myeloma
Neuroectodermal --> Glioma/neuroblastoma
Embryonic (immature tissue) --> Blastoma
