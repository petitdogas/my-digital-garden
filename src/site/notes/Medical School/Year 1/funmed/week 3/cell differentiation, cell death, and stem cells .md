# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Briefly describe how cells become more specialised as they start to differentiate
- [ ] Describe how external and internal regulators of cell specific differentiation control this process
- [ ] Describe the process of necrosis
- [ ] Describe the process of apoptosis and how it is controlled
- [ ] Define and Describe what is a stem cells and how it is maintained in its stem cell state and the changes with age and disease

# Stem Cells
- can divide to self-renew indefinitely
## Potency of Stem Cells
- zygote = totipotent
	- any cell in body/placenta
- embryonic stem cells = pluripotent
	- cells within the blastocyst (inner cell mass)
- cells localised within embryo = multipotent
	- gastrulation
- cells of one lineage = unipotent

## Stem Cell Division
### Symmetrical cell division
- stem cell divides and both daughters exactly the same
	- both are stem cells or both are committed
### Asymmetric division
- stem cell divides and both daughters are different
	- one remains a stem cell the other becomes committed
### Asymmetrical cell fate specification
- unequal segregation of a cell fate determinant
## Use of Stem Cells
- regeneration of tissues under constant stress or damaged by trauma
## Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPS cells)
- somatic cells reprogrammed using factors which induce self-renewal and pluripotency
- can make any cell (e.g. replacing teeth)
## Stem Cells and Cancer
- cancer stem cells can lead to new tumours and new progenitors of tumours

# Differentiation
- three basic categories of cells found in the body
	- germ cells
	- somatic cells
	- stem cells
- gene expression managed by transcription factors
	- change the cell's specification/differentiation
		- changes affect cells downstream (daughter cells)

# Stages of Cell Commitment
## Specification
???
- reversible
- will commit unless environment changes

## Determination
???
- irreversible commitment
- differentiates regardless of landscape

## Differentiation
- becomes specialised cell

# Epigenetic Landscape in Cellular Reprogramming

- dedifferentiation
	- cell reverts to a less-specialised progenitor state within a discrete lineage
- transdetermination
	- cell dedifferentiates to a less-committed progenitor state and then switches lineages to re-differentiate to a cell type in a new lineage.
- transdifferentiation
	- cell moves directly from one lineage to another without moving through a dedifferentiated or pluripotent intermediate

# Cell Death
![cell differentiation, cell death, and stem cells -20241008124346331.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%203/attachments/cell%20differentiation,%20cell%20death,%20and%20stem%20cells%20-20241008124346331.png)
## Apoptosis
- programmed cell death
- avoids release of cell contents
### extrinsic
- TNF induced and Fas pathway
- both use receptors
### intrinsic
- targets the mitochondria
### Caspsases
#### Initiator caspases
- caspase 2, **8, 9**, 10
#### Executioner caspases
- caspase **3**, 6, and **7**
#### Non-apoptotic caspases
- caspase 1, 4, 5, and 11
## Necrosis
- cell or tissue damage due to external factors
- leads to release of xa cell's content
	- causes an inflammatory response

### Treatment
??
- antioxidants
- surgical removal of necrotic tissue
	- debridement
- maggot debridement therapy
	- remove necrotic tissue and suppress infection
	- accelerate wound healing

# Senescence
- cells remain metabolically active
- irreversible proliferative arrest
- cells are still structurally important
- can lead to tumorigenesis longer term
- tissue ageing
- prevents proliferation of potentially damaged cells whilst maintaining tissue homeostasis

# Loss of apoptosis and senescence can be seen in cancer
- premalignant tumours contain a mixed population of tumour cells
	- cells undergoing apoptosis or senescence
	- mixed population explains restricted growth of these lesions
- malignant tumours
	- balance between proliferating vs apoptotic/senescent cells is tipped to one side
		- in favour of proliferation
