# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Describe different types of cell to cell (intercellular) communication
- [ ] Describe the steps and components in a simple intracellular pathway including ligand, receptor, adapter protein, signalling molecules and second messengers
- [ ] Understand how signals may activate/inactivate different responses in cells. 
- [ ] How intracellular signals can act as molecular switches via phosphorylation
- [ ] Recognise the importance of cell communication in physiological and pathophysiological conditions

# Autocrine Signalling
- single signalling cell receives a weak autocrine signal
	- cell produces a hormone
		- the ligand binds to receptors on the same cell / group of cells

# Intercellular Signalling
## Types

### Contact-Dependent
- cells make direct contact with each other
- signalling cell has signal molecule which is received by the target cell
- example
	- cells in embryonic development differentiate into different types of cells

### Paracrine
- {{short distant}} secretion of signals
- signals stay close to signalling cell and bind to receptors which are on cells close by
- example
	- cytokines (inflammation regulation)
### Neuronal
- electrical impulses carried along axons across synapses
### Endocrine
- hormones secreted into bloodstream
- example
	- insulin

# Intracellular Signalling
![cell communication-20241008132147994.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%203/attachments/cell%20communication-20241008132147994.png)
- intercellular signalling proteins interact with **target proteins** to change the behaviour of the cell
## Second Messengers
- relay signals received at receptors on the cell surface to effector proteins
### cAMP (cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate)
- {{adrenaline}} binds to receptor
	- GDP -> GTP (like ATP but guanine instead) activates {{adenylyl cyclase}}
		- ATP -> cAMP
			- cAMP is degraded by enzyme {{phosphodiesterase}}
### Calcium
- Ca2+ stored in the ER
	- Ca2+ enter the cytosol via ion channels when released from the ER
		- bind to proteins and trigger events within the cell
			- signals deactivated by pumping ions back into ER
## Molecular switches
- switched on then off
	- protein kinase -> on -> protein phosphatase -> off

# Acetylcholine
## Hyperpolarisation in cardiac muscle
- muscarinic Ach receptors (mAChRs)
	- G-protein-coupled receptors that activate other ionic channels via a second messenger cascade
		- activation causes hyperpolarisation
			- inhibitory response induces bradycardia
## Depolarisation in skeletal muscle
- nicotinic Ach receptors (nAChR)
	- non-selective cation channels
- excitatory
	- induces contraction

## Secretion in pancreatic acinar cells
- muscarinic Ach receptors (mACHR)
- leads to secretion of digestive enzymes

# Insulin Signalling Pathways

# Diabetes mellitus type 1 - not enough signal
- insufficient production of insulin
	- GLUT4 not translocated to membrane
		- less internalisation of glucose into the cell
			- hyperglycaemia

# Stroke - too much signal
- blood vessel blockage causes death of brain cells nearby
	- dying cells release {{glutamate}}
		- toxic at high concentrates
			- {{excitotoxicity}} - glutamate activates signal pathways causing more apoptosis on top of the necrosis
				- further, more widespread damage to the brain

# Excess Signalling and Cancer

- {{angiogenesis}} is the proliferation of blood vessels
