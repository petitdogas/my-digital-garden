# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Describe the main features of the cell cycle
- [ ] Describe the mechanisms and biological functions of mitosis
- [ ] Discuss the role of genes in coordinating the cell cycle
- [ ] Give example of human diseases associated with mutations in these genes

# The Cell Cycle

## Interphase
### G-phases
- Gap phases
- No DNA synthesis
- Provides time for the cell to check internal and external conditions to ensure conditions are suitable for the next phase
- Checkpoints
	- cell either continues dividing or undergoes apoptosis

### S phase
- synthesis phase
- DNA duplication (2N to 4N)
## M-phase
### Prophase
- nucleolus disappears
- chromatin condenses
- microtubules disassemble
- mitotic spindle begins to form
### Pro/Metaphase
- nuclear envelope disappears
- microtubules attach to centromeres
	- at the kinetochore
- centrosomes move towards opposite ends of cells
- chromosomes aligned at metaphase plate
### Anaphase
- spindle microtubules retract
- sister chromatids pulled apart through their kinetochores
- spindles move further apart towards poles
- Cohesin
	- protein complex that regulates the separation of sister chromatids during cell division (both mitosis and meiosis). They hold chromatids together until anaphase.
	- Cohesinopathies
		- leads to extra or less chromosomes due to non-disjunction â€“ e.g. Cornelia de Lange syndrome, trisomy 21.
### Telophase
- centrioles, centrosomes, spindle fibres disappear
- nuclear envelope starts to form
## Cytokinesis
- splitting of cytoplasm in two
- actin and myosin contractile ring pinches and cleaves the cell
	- invagination at the centre of cell
		- formation of cleavage furrow
			- furrow deepens until two daughter cells separated

# Meiosis
## Prophase I
- chromosome replication forms homologous chromosomes
- chromosomes condense
- homologous chromosomes align at centre of cell
	- joined at chiasmata, forming bivalents
- nuclear envelope breaks down
### Crossing Over / Recombination
- at chiasmata, exchange of genetic material between both homologous chromosomes
	- chromosomal crossover

## Metaphase I
- nuclear envelope breaks down
### Independent Assortment
- - pairs of homologous chromosomes move to centre of the cell
	- face opposite sides of the spindle
		- this is random placement

## Anaphase I
- chromosomes separate
- kinetochore microtubules shorten and pull chromosomes in opposite directions
	- sister chromatids remain attached
		- each pole gets two copies of the same chromosome

## Telophase I
- microtubules disappear
- new nuclear envelope
- chromosomes -> chromatin
- sister chromatids remain attached

## Cytokinesis I
- cytoplasm splits, forming two daughter cells
- cell enters interkinesis / interphase II
	- no DNA replication occurs here

The rest of meiosis is the same as mitosis, just no DNA duplication occurs.

### Non-autosomal

# Control of the Cell Cycle
- Cyclins
- Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)
- Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs)
	- these are phosphatases

Cyclin D1 forms active complexes that promote G1 -> S
- phosphorylates retinoblastoma protein (Rb)
	- inhibits Rb

Start of S phase
- cyclin A and CDK2 phosphorylate initiate DNA replication

In mitosis, cyclin B phosphorylates proteins which regulate microtubule behaviour

Following activation of p53 (e.g. by viral infection) cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21 expression is upregulated
- inhibits CDK2 in G1
	- prevents the cell from entering the cell cycle

# Retinoblastoma
- genetic defects in the retinoblastoma gene
- Rb is a tumour suppressor
	- prevents DNA synthesis and replication
- mutant pRb does not prevent cell cycle progression past G1
	- uncontrolled growth (retinoblastoma)
