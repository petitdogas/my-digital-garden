# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Identify normal epithelial tissue and describe histology.
- [ ] Have an overview of the different developmental stages which lead up to tumour development:
	- hyperplasia
	- metaplasia
	- dysplasia
- [ ] Be able to describe the abnormal cells and gross tissue changes observed in tumour development.

# Stages of Tumour Development

## (Metaplasia)
- one type of normal cell is replaced by another cell type which shouldn't be in that tissue
	- cells migrate into the area where the pathological/physiological stress occurs
- metaplasia does not appear in most cancers
## Hyperplasia
- proliferation of cells within an organ or tissue
	- may not progress
	- may form a benign tumour
## Dysplasia
- dysplastic cells with an abnormal growth pattern
- cells begin to dedifferentiate
- often indicative of an early neoplastic process
	- oncogenic process which may lead to a cancerous stage
	- precancerous
### changes in cytoarchitecture
- change in nuclear size and shape
- {{nuclear:cytoplasmic}} ratio
- increased mitotic activity
- change in the relative numbers of specific cell types
### in the cervix
- also known as {{cervical intraepithelial neoplasia}} (CIN)
	- intraepithelial means abnormal cells have not invaded the basement membrane
- HPV-16 and HPV-18

## Carcinoma in situ
- cells lose their regular function
- may have invasive potential
	- could result in a malignant tumour
## Invasive Cancer
- cells have the ability to metastasise
