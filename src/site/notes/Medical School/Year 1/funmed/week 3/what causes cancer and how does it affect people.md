# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Appreciate the role of health psychology in creating effective messaging around cancer risk
- [ ] UnderstandÂ  that many health protective behaviours should be established as early in life as possible in order to be effective
- [ ] To understand the concept of aetiology of cancer with specific examples
- [ ] To be able to provide a simple explanation of the formation of DNA adducts and pyrimidine dimers
- [ ] Define an ultimate carcinogen

# DNA damage
## Formation of DNA adducts in lung cancer
- BP - polycyclic hydrocarbon in cigarette smoke can be oxidised in lungs
	- converted into {{BPDE}} (ultimate carcinogen)
		- highly mutagenic
- ultimate carcinogens form DNA adducts
	- distortion in DNA shape causes mutation
BPDE interacts with guanine
- mutations in p53 are commonly observed in lung cancers in smokers

## Formation of DNA adducts in alcohol related cancers
- ethanol --> acetaldehyde by ADH --> acetic acid by ALDH
	- if lots of acetaldehyde, {{deoxyguanosine}} will react
		- forms weak mutagen
			- can undergo further reactions to form a stronger mutagen

## DNA damage by UV radiation
- formation of pyrimidine dimers on the same DNA strand
	- {{Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers}} (CPDs) are very stable
		- in basal cell carcinomas, TP53 alleles have dipyrimidine substitution
### UVA
- longer wavelength
	- penetrates deeper into the skin
		- associated with squamous cell carcinoma
### UVB
- causes sunburn
- associated with basal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma

## Viruses
