# Connective Tissue
- forms a matrix beneath the epithelial layer and acts as a supporting framework (stroma) for most other structures and organs in the body
- primarily 3 components
	- ground substance (glycoproteins, proteoglycans)
	- fibres (elastin, collagen)
	- sparsely populated with cells that produce the ECM (fibrocytes, adipocyte, macrophage)

# Cells
## Resident Cells
### Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts
Fibroblasts
- most common resident cell
- responsible for collagen secretion
	- essential for normal development and repair
- spindle shaped cell with elliptical nucleus
	- only the nucleus is visible in quiescent cells with H&E staining

Myofibroblasts
- properties of both fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells
	- contraction
- similar appearance to fibroblast
- express α-smooth muscle actin
- lack external basal lamina
	- different to smooth muscle cells

### Macrophages
- phagocytic cells from monocytes
- microscopically visible only when they display phagocytic activity
- kidney-shaped nucleus

### Mast Cells
- large cells with spherical nucleus
- large basophilic granules in cytoplasm
- found in connective tissue of skin and mucous membranes
	- not found in brain and spinal cord
![connective tissue histology-20241007101915210.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%203/attachments/connective%20tissue%20histology-20241007101915210.png)
### Adipocytes
- signet-ring appearance
- store fat and produce hormones
- in large numbers, called adipose tissue
![connective tissue histology-20241007101921359.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%203/attachments/connective%20tissue%20histology-20241007101921359.png)
### Adult Stem Cells
- only differentiate into lineage specific cells (multipotent)

## Wandering Cells
- hematopoietic system
	- Lymphocytes
	- Plasma cells
	- Neutrophils
	- Eosinophils
	- Basophils
	- Monocytes

# General Characteristics: Fibres
## Collagen
- most abundant
- thickest and strongest
- great tensile strength
- holds structures together
### [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 1/extracellular matrix and cell adhesion#Types of Collagen\|Types of Collagen]]
## Reticular
- very thin collagenous fibres (type III)
- highly branched
	- loose, allowing passage of cells and fluid
- form supporting stroma for highly cellular organs (liver, bone marrow)

## Elastic
- bundles of fibrillin embedded in elastin
- branched fibres
- pliable

# Ground Substance
- consists mainly of water
- provides a route for communication and transport (by diffusion) between tissues
- GAGs
	- hyaluronic acid
	- chrondoitin sulfate
	- keratan sulfate
- proteoglycans
	- aggrecan
	- versican
- glycoproteins
	- [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 1/extracellular matrix and cell adhesion#Fibronectin and Laminin\|laminin and fibronectin]]
- determine the consistency of the ECM

# Classification of Connective Tissues
## Embryonic connective tissue
### mesenchymal connective tissue
- found in embryo
- develops into adult muscle, vascular  and urogenital systems and the serous membranes
- small spindle-shaped cells
### mucous connective tissue (Wharton's jelly)
- found in umbilical cord
- protects umbilical cord vessels
	- fibroblasts, macrophages
- thin collagen fibres visible
## Connective tissue proper
### loose (areolar) connective tissue
- similar to adipose tissue in both structure and function
	- not nutrient storing
- fibroblasts, mast cells, macrophages
### dense connective tissue
#### dense irregular connective tissue
- lining bones and cartilage, joint capsules
- sustain tension under many directions
![connective tissue histology-20241007104335050.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%203/attachments/connective%20tissue%20histology-20241007104335050.png)
#### dense regular connective tissue
- tendons and ligaments
- collagen fibres with fibroblasts
![connective tissue histology-20241007104343402.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%203/attachments/connective%20tissue%20histology-20241007104343402.png)

### elastic connective tissue
- fibroblasts
- densely packed
- some collagen fibres
### reticular tissue (also classified as specialised connective tissue)
- branched, meshlike
- type III collagen fibres
- highly cellular locations
### adipose tissue (also classified as specialised connective tissue)
#### white adipose tissue
- large, white, spherical
- single large vacuole: unilocular
- subcutaneously, mammary glands, mesenteries, retroperitoneal spaces, visceral  pericardium, orbits and bone marrow cavity
- insulation, energy storage and hormone production (leptin, angiotensinogen, adiponectin and resistin)
#### brown adipose tissue
- present during foetal life
- smaller cells, eccentric nucleus
- many vacuoles (multilocular)
- brown colour
	- due to high levels of cytochrome oxidase in mitochondria
- differentiate from mesenchymal stem cells
- thermogenesis
## Specialised connective tissue
### cartilage
- more than 95% of it is ECM
- avascular
- contain GAGs and few collagen type II fibres
#### 3 types of cartilage
##### hyaline cartilage
- collagen II fibres, GAGs and glycoproteins
- chondrocytes located in lacunae
- lubrication of joints and tension absorption
- basophilia in ECM
- surrounded by dense connective tissue layer called perichondrium
##### elastic cartilage
- presence of elastin in the  ECM (plus collagen II)
- ear and the epiglottis of the larynx
- surrounded by perichondrium
##### fibrocartilage
- chrondrocytes and fibroblasts surrounded by collagen I and less rigid ECM
- no perichondrium
- intermediate tissue between hyaline cartilage and dense connective tissue
- intervertebral discs, pubic symphysis
#### Chondrogenesis
- chondroblasts produce and deposit collagen II fibres and ECM (hyaluronic acid and GAGs)
- build up of ECM, cells are separated and trapped within matrix spaces called lacunae
- two mechanisms
##### interstitial growth
- from chondrocytes within the cartilage
- territorial matrix
	- the matrix in close contact with the chondrocyte (bluish metachromatic, H&E, basket-like structure)
- interterritorial matrix
	- matrix that separates the clustered chondrocytes (isogenous group), enveloped by the territorial matrix
![connective tissue histology-20241007105303071.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%203/attachments/connective%20tissue%20histology-20241007105303071.png)
##### appositional growth
- from undifferentiated cells at the surface of the cartilage or perichondrium
- •perichondrium
	- reticular fibrous layer by clustered outermost cartilage cells, the zone between cartilage and surrounding general connective tissue
- perichondrium inner cells differentiate into chondroblasts
	- synthesise/secrete collagen II and ECM components
![connective tissue histology-20241007105352620.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%203/attachments/connective%20tissue%20histology-20241007105352620.png)

New cell layers and ECM are added to the surface of the cartilage
•Chondrocytes completely surrounded by matrix
1. bone
2. blood
