# What are they?
- small proteins or glycoproteins
- act via specific receptors
- some are called interleukins
- some are tumour necrosis factors (TNF), interferons (IFN)
- include a subfamily involved in chemotaxis - chemokines

# Chemokines
- small polypeptides
- signal through GPCRs
	- can bind multiple chemokines
- leukocytes differentially express chemokine receptors
- control adhesion, chemotaxis, adhesion

# Attributes of cytokines
- pleiotropy - cytokine can have multiple effects
- redundancy - different cytokines do the same job
- synergy - cytokines act together to cause an effect
- antagonism - cytokines can have opposing effects
- autocrine - same cell is the target
- paracrine - nearby cell is the target
- endocrine - distant cell is target

# Positive effects on the immune response
## Damage and infection stimulates inflammation
- macrophages release TNFα for local response (initiates inflammatory response and stimulates clotting)
- CXCL8 drives leukocyte recruitment
	- neutrophils and monocytes (innate immune cells) make reactive oxygen species to kill bacteria before adaptive immune cells (T and B cells) migrate a few days later
## Recruitment of immune cells
- cytokines make the endothelium of blood vessels stickier
- chemokines activate adhesion molecules and allow arrest of the flow of the immune cell
- immune cell is directed into infected site
## T-cell proliferation
- activated T cell produces and releases IL-2
	- autocrine - T cell has receptors for IL-2
		- stimulates proliferation
## Differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells

# What do activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T-helper cells do?
- differentiate into different types of CD4<sup>+</sup> effector T cells
	- e.g. Th1 or Th2
## Th0 cells
- cytokines turn Th0 cells into either Th1 or Th2 cells
- IL-12 and IL-23 generate Th1 cells
	- these interleukins come from dendritic cells following stimulation of TLRs
- IL-4 generates Th2 cells
	- IL-4 from mast cells
## CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cell
- cell-mediated immunity (intracellular pathogens)
- Th1 cells recognise receptors on infected macrophages, producing IFN-γ
	- helps activate the macrophage
		- upregulation of oxidation for digestion of pathogen
- if activation cannot eliminate the pathogen e.g. in tuberculosis
	- formation of granulomas to wall off the infection
## CD4<sup>+</sup> Th2 cell
- humoral immunity (defence against parasitic worms / [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 9/cytokines#Allergies\|allergies]])
- B cell presents antigens on MHC-II, binding to CD4<sup>+</sup> Th2 cell
	- Th2 cell releases [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 9/cytokines\|cytokines]]
		- IL-4, IL-5, IL-13
			- IL-4 induces [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 9/how does the immune system recognise pathogens#class switching\|class switching]] in B cells to make IgE
## CD4<sup>+</sup> Th17 cell
- defence against extracellular bacteria (autoimmunity)
- induced by TGFβ and IL-6/IL-21
- releases IL-17 and IL-22
## CD4<sup>+</sup> iT-Reg Cell
- immunosuppression (autoimmunity, cancer)
- induced by TGFβ in isolation
- releases TGFβ and other suppressive molecules

# Negative effects on the immune response
## Uncontrolled systemic production of TNFα
- widespread bacterial infection ([[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 9/inflammation#Sepsis\|sepsis]])
- septic shock - fever, hypotension, diarrhoea, clotting, death
- toxic shock syndrome: ‘superantigens’ activate many T cells & drive overproduction of cytokines
## Allergies
- overproduction of IL-4
	- more Th2 CD4<sup>+</sup> cells
		- more IL-4
			- B cells make more IgE
				- mast cells --> immune response

# Antiviral actions of IFNα and IFNβ
- in a virally infected cell, engagement of PRRs stimulates production of IFNs
- IFNs induce a resistant state in adjacent cells
- increase MHC expression, activate NK cells
# Cytokines in the clinic
## Administering cytokines
- major challenges around very short half-lives in vivo
- interferon α - used in treatment of hepatitis B infection and some cancers
- GM-CSF - leukine used to stimulate production of [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 5/blood#Blood Cell Development\|myeloid cells]] after bone marrow transplantation
## Using mAbs to block the action of cytokines e.g. TNFα
- infliximab - chimeric antibody
- major impact on treatment of Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis…
