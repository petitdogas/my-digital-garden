# Cell-Mediated Immune Response
- CD8<sup>+</sup> cells have a [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 9/how does the immune system recognise pathogens#T cells\|TCRαβ]] and the CD8 co-receptor
- [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 9/how does the immune system recognise pathogens#MHC molecules\|MHC-I ]]is recognised by CD8<sup>+</sup> cells
- Binding of CD8<sup>+</sup> to infected cell induces apoptosis
	- Nuclear "blebbing", alteration in cell morphology, DNA fragmentation by controlled digestion by nuclease enzymes, shedding of vesicles, cell membrane remains intact
		- apoptotic bodies are removed by phagocytes

## How do cytotoxic T cells induce apoptosis?
- lytic granules are modified lysosomes
- perforin forms pores in cell membrane
- granzymes bind to proteins in the cell membrane and start digesting proteins within the target cell
- nucleases within cell are activated and digest DNA, inducing apoptosis

### Cytotoxic effector molecules are released in a precisely focussed manner
- non-specific adhesion
- TCR:MHC:peptide interaction
- reorganisation of microtubule organising centre and golgi apparatus within the CD8<sup>+</sup> cell
- lytic granule release
- cell death by apoptosis

# Natural Killer (NK) Cells
- part of the innate immune system
- they are lymphocytes without antigen-specific receptors
- activated by cytokines
- kill cells using perforin and granzymes
- recognise self only, so if they don't get a self signal, they kill
