# Recognition
- CD4<sup>+</sup> cell recognise antigen using a TCR
	- antigen is presented by MHC-II on an APC
		- e.g. dendritic cells, macrophages etc.

# What do activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T-helper cells do?
- differentiate into different types of CD4<sup>+</sup> effector T cells
	- e.g. Th1 or Th2
## Th0 cells
- cytokines turn Th0 cells into either Th1 or Th2 cells
- IL-12 and IL-23 generate Th1 cells
	- these interleukins come from dendritic cells following stimulation of TLRs
- IL-4 generates Th2 cells
	- IL-4 from mast cells
## CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cell
- cell-mediated immunity (intracellular pathogens)
- Th1 cells recognise receptors on infected macrophages, producing IFN-γ
	- helps activate the macrophage
		- upregulation of oxidation for digestion of pathogen
- if activation cannot eliminate the pathogen e.g. in tuberculosis
	- formation of granulomas to wall off the infection
## CD4<sup>+</sup> Th2 cell
- humoral immunity (defence against parasitic worms / [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 9/cytokines#Allergies\|allergies]])
- B cell presents antigens on MHC-II, binding to CD4<sup>+</sup> Th2 cell
	- Th2 cell releases [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 9/cytokines\|cytokines]]
		- IL-4, IL-5, IL-13
			- IL-4 induces [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 9/how does the immune system recognise pathogens#class switching\|class switching]] in B cells to make IgE
## CD4<sup>+</sup> Th17 cell
- defence against extracellular bacteria (autoimmunity)
- induced by TGFβ and IL-6/IL-21
- releases IL-17 and IL-22
## CD4<sup>+</sup> iT-Reg Cell
- immunosuppression (autoimmunity, cancer)
- induced by TGFβ in isolation
- releases TGFβ and other suppressive molecules
# When things go wrong
## Leprosy
### Tuberculoid Leprosy
- Th1 is dominant response - IFNγ
- collateral nerve damage associated with Th1 response
### Lepromatous Leprosy
- Th2 is dominant response - IL-4
- bacteria population poorly controlled - lots of bacterial growth as humoral immunity is not good at dealing with intracellular bacteria
- hyperglobulinaemia - lots of antibodies

## Leishmaniasis
### Cutaneous Leishmaniasis
- Th1 is dominant response
- limited disease
### Visceral Leishmaniasis
- Th2 is dominant response
- disseminated disease

## Tuberculosis
### Lepromatous TB
- Th1 dominant
- limited disease
### Miliary TB
- Th2 dominant
- disseminated disease
## Allergies
- Th2 responses lead to IL-4 which leads to IgE, causing allergic reactions
