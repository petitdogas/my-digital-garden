# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Define inflammation, its symptoms and cardinal signs.
- [ ] Describe the vascular & cellular processes that characterise the acute inflammatory response.
- [ ] Define the term 'mediator of inflammation' and list the prominent mediators of inflammation and their basic functions.
- [ ] List the outcomes of acute inflammation.
- [ ] Describe the stages of wound healing

# Initiation of acute inflammation
## Intrinsic Factors
- necrosis
- stomach acid
- metabolic products
- immunological factors
## Extrinsic Factors
- infection
- acids, heavy metals, harmful fumes
- cuts, extreme temperatures

## Steps of an innate immune response
- tissue damage and mediator release
- fluid, plasma proteins and cells move into tissue
- cells move to site of inflammation
- killing of pathogen

### Damage and Activation
- receptors e.g. TLRs recognise
	- [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 9/how does the immune system recognise pathogens#by innate immune cells\|PAMPs]] (pathogen associated molecular patterns)
	- DAMPs (damage associated molecular patterns)
- mediator release
	- cell-derived preformed mediators are immediately released e.g. histamine
	- cell-derived newly-synthesisesd mediators e.g. cytokines take a while to be released
	- plasma protein-derived mediators from the liver

### Movement into tissue
- normally, plasma proteins in circulation
- transudate, fluid leaks into tissues but proteins remain in circulation
- exudate, fluid and proteins leak into tissue
- cellular influx into tissue
	- margination - movement to outside of vessels
	- rolling - via selectins
	- firm adherence - via integrins
	- transmigration - movement between endothelia cells into tissue

### Cells move to site of inflammation
- chemotaxis - directional movement of cells towards and extracellular chemoattractant against a concentration gradient
- pro-inflammatory mediators
	- leukotrienes and prostaglandins
	- chemokines
	- complement components C5a and C3a

#### Killing of Pathogen
- phagocytosis - engulfment and digestion of material by phagocytic cells
	- Fc receptors bind to antibody
	- complement receptors
	- [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 8/how microbes cause disease#Phagolysosome\|breakdown material]]
- presentation of antigen to T cells
- cytokine production

##### in addition to phagocytosis
- granule release
- trapping extracellular pathogens in neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)
- direct cell lysis by mediators and cells
	- complement mediated lysis
	- [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 9/how do we eliminate pathogens which live inside a cell#Natural Killer (NK) Cells\|NK cell mediated by perforin and granzymes]]

# Sepsis
- [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 9/cytokines#Uncontrolled systemic production of TNFÎ±\|Overwhelming immune response]] to pathogenic microorganism that gain access to lymphatic system then circulatory systems, or the circulatory system directly

# Cardinal signs
- redness - vasodilation
- swelling - exudation of fluid and cells into tissue
- heat - increased blood flue and exudation of fluid
- pain - exudates stretch pain receptors and nerves
- loss of function - pain and disruption of tissue structure

# Chronic Inflammation
## Causes
- prolonged acute inflammation - chronic osteomyelitis
- repeated acute inflammation - alcoholic cirrhosis, silicosis
- infection - tuberculosis, leprosy
- autoimmune disease - multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthiritis

## Cells involved in chronic inflammation
- B cells mature into plasma cells which secrete antibodies
- CD8<sup>+</sup> cells activated by the recognition of peptides from endogenous sources for direct killing of virally infected or cancer cells
- CD4<sup>+</sup> cells activated by recognition of peptides from exogenous sources expressed on APCs 
- macrophages activated by cytokines or PRRs

# Wound Healing
## [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 5/haemostasis and thrombosis\|Haemostasis]]
## Inflammation
## Proliferative Phase
- fibroblasts migrate to the wound site and proliferate
	- produces ECM components (collagen, elastin, proteoglycans)
- labile and stable cells can proliferate
- permanent cells cannot proliferate because they have left cell cycle (cardiac cells)
- angiogenesis
## Remodelling
- collagen fibres undergo crosslinking and reorganisation to increase tensile strength
- excess collagen degraded by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)
- results in scar formation

# Considerations and complications
- Dehiscence (splitting apart)
- Discolouration
- Scar
- Adhesion
- Incisional hernia
- Infections
