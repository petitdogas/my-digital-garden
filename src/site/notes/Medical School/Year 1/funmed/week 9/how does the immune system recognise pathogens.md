# Learning Objectives
- [ ] The ability to discriminate ‘self’ from ‘non-self’ is an essential property of the immune system
- [ ] Innate immune cells recognise a limited number of microbial structures using pattern recognition receptors– non reactivity to self is in-built.
- [ ] T & B cells have highly diverse receptors generated by somatic DNA recombination. Receptor generation is random; cells with self-reactive receptors eliminated or controlled  (‘tolerance’).
- [ ] B cells recognise antigens in solution using cell surface immunoglobulin molecules & are activated to secrete antibodies with a variety of effector functions.
- [ ] T cells recognise peptide antigens displayed in MHC molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APC)
- [ ] MHC genes are polymorphic and polygenic - maximises the array of potential peptides that can be presented to the immune system

# Definitions
- antigen
	- anything taht binds to a specific receptor on an immune cell
- immunogen
	- anything that elicits an immune response
- epitope
	- the portion of an antigen that is recognised and bound by a receptor on an immune cell

# Antigen Recognition
## by innate immune cells
- Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) recognise Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs)
- PAMPs are found in microbes but not in humans
	- e.g. human cells don't have cell walls or flagella
		- therefore they only recognise non-self antigens (there are no self antigens with these characteristics)

### Toll Like Receptors (TLRs)
- multiple toll like receptors recognise different molecular patterns

- activate signalling pathways to induce inflammatory [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 9/cytokines\|cytokine]] production

## by adaptive immune cells
### B cells
- antigen recognition molecules used by B cells are called **immunoglobulins (Ig)**
	- membrane bound Ig functions as the B-cell receptor (BCR)
- antigens are recognised without the aid of other cells
- activated B cells differentiate into plasma cells, secreting immunoglobulin (antibodies)

#### Structure of an antibody
- two identical heavy chains; two identical light chains
![how does the immune system recognise pathogens-20241118101517880.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%209/attachments/how%20does%20the%20immune%20system%20recognise%20pathogens-20241118101517880.png)
- variable region determines which antibody is recognised

#### class switching
- there are isotypes of antibodies
	- each class of antibodies mediates different biological functions
		- IgM, IgG, IgE, IgA
![how does the immune system recognise pathogens-20241118101740469.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%209/attachments/how%20does%20the%20immune%20system%20recognise%20pathogens-20241118101740469.png)
- starts off as IgM but switches to IgG
	- if you look at someone's levels of IgM and IgG, you can roughly determine how long ago they were infected

#### Generation of Receptor Diversity
- 'mixing and matching' gene segments within the heavy chain and light chain loci
##### somatic DNA recombination
- bit of DNA by the D region gets spliced out at random
- D-J joining
- more splicing by the V region
- V-DJ joining
- transcription to make mRNA
	- mRNA is spliced to remove introns and then translated to make the heavy/light chain and immunoglobulin molecule is assembled
V = variable
D = diversity
J = joining
### T cells
- recognise antigen using a T cell receptor (TCR)
- APC presents antigen to the T cell using the **major histocompatibility complex (MHC)**
- TCR composed of two chains with a variable and constant region
- T cells begin to express TCRs during development in the thymus
#### MHC molecules
- major histocompatibility complex
- two classes
	- MHC Class-I is on all cells
		- presents antigens to CD8<sup>+</sup>
	- MHC Class-II is only on APCs
		- presents antigens to CD4<sup>+</sup>
- these are not specific for a single peptide, but rather bind to a range of related peptides
	- this is because they are **polygenic** and **polymorphic**

##### Coeliac Disease
- chronic inflammation of the small intestine
	- immune response to wheat gluten
- only occurs in people carrying specific MHC class II molecules
	- HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8
	- these MHC class II molecules present gliadin peptides found in the gluten to CD4<sup>+</sup>

# Immunological Tolerance
- immune system eliminates cells which recognise self antigens
## Central Tolerance
- receptors in developing immune cells are tested for self antigen recognition
	- if self reactivity is too strong, the cells are killed
## Peripheral Tolerance
- control of lymphocytes which escape central tolerance via regulatory T cells (T<sub>reg</sub>)
