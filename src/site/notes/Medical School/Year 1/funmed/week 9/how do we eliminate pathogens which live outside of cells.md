# Learning Objectives
- [ ] How do the cells and molecules of the immune system work as an integrated defence system to eliminate or control an infectious agent?
- [ ] How does the immune system provide long-lasting protective immunity?

# Antibodies
- mature B cells release antibodies

	- µ = IgM = **pentamer**
	- δ = IgD, γ = IgG, ε = IgE = **monomer**
	- α = IgA = **dimer**
-  B cells make antibodies with different F<sub>C</sub>

## Roles of Antibodies
- Neutralisation
- Agglutination
- Opsonisation
- Antibody-dependent cell killing
- Activation of complement

## Affinity maturation
- B cells make an antibody with a "better fit" to antigen
- occurs in germinal centres in lymph nodes and spleen
- random mutation of immunoglobulin genes

# Complement Cascade

- first part of the innate immune response
### opsonisation (C3b) and pathogen clearance by phagocytes
### MAC : membrane attack complex (C5b) and direct lysis of pathogens
### enhancing inflammation (C5a)
- activation and recruitment of phagocytic cells by anaphylatoxins (C5a, C3a) released by digestion of complements components
