# Main Routes of Drug Administration
## Oral Route
- through the gut wall and the liver
	- first-pass metabolism
- onset > 30 min
- tablets, capsules, syrups, suspensions etc.

| Advantages                    | Disadvantages                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| safest                        | slow onset of action                           |
| most convenient               | unconscious patients                           |
| non-invasive                  | degradation from GIT and inactivation in liver |
| solids and liquids            | interference from other components in gut      |
| no external assistance needed | might cause irritation                         |
| cost-effective                | tastes bad (bitter)                            |
| no sterile precautions needed | first pass metabolism                          |
## Sublingual Route
- rapidly absorbed by mucosa under the tongue
- onset in a few mins
- goes to the systemic circulation

| Advantages                              | Disadvantages                |

|                                                  | inconvenient                           |
## Vaginal Route
- topical delivery of drugs into the vagina
- systemic drug delivery and uterine targeting also possible

| Advantages                                                                     | Disadvantages                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| accessible and non-invasive                                                    | cultural and hygiene issues                                                                                                                                |
| highly perfused tissue with a well-developed<br>blood supply                   | poor drug retention                                                                                                                                        |

^high oestrogen = high permeability

## Parenteral Route
- "outside of GI tract"
- commonly refers to injections

| Advantages                                  | Disadvantages                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| avoids limitations with oral administration | aseptic techniques required           |
| rapid onset of action                       | invasive and painful                  |
|                                             | can cause irritation or infection     |
|                                             | assistance of another person required |
### Other Routes of Parenteral Injections
- Intrathecal: an injection into the spinal canal, or into the subarachnoid space
- Epidural: Outside of spinal dura
- Intraosseous: Into the marrow of the bone
- Intra-arterial: into the artery (tumours) - diagnostic applications
- Intravitreal: used by ophthalmic surgeons to treat conditions like age-related macular degeneration
- Intra-articular: into the joint such as corticosteroids
## Pulmonary Route
- for local and systemic actions
- aerosolised agents target the lung topically
	- e.g. salbutamol
- drug diffuses across alveolar membrane (systemic effect)
	- e.g. nitrous oxide

## Nasal Route
- rapid onset (5 mins)
- local administrations
- can be used for systemic administration
	- nasal cavity has a well vascularised mucosa
- nasal-brain drug delivery bypasses the BBB

## Topical Route
- creams for the skin (skin penetration)

| Advantages                 | Disadvantages                                               |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| local therapeutic effect   | some drugs cannot be absorbed<br>through the skin or mucosa |
| lower risk of side effects |                                                             |
- e.g. antibiotics, antiseptics, local anaesthetics, NSAIDs

## Transdermal Route
- drug absorbed percutaneously (systemic)
- comparable to injections
- long-term continuous delivery of drug

| Advantages                            | Disadvantages        |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| bypasses first stage metabolism       | drugs must be potent |
| stable drug levels in plasma achieved | skin irritation      |

- e.g. nitroglycerine, contraceptives, nicotine

# How to choose how to administer
- physiochemical properties of the drug  
- pharmacokinetics of the drug- onset and duration of action  
- effect of the GI tract fluids and first-pass metabolism on the drug  
- site of desired action local or systemic  
- mode of drug effect - immediate or prolonged  
- convenience - condition of the patients

# Drug Absorption
- ability of drug to diffuse across membranes depends on its **molecular size** and **lipophilicity**
- undissociated form is lipid soluble, dissociated form is water soluble
- efficacy and rate of absorption depends on route of administration
- in general, most drugs
	- are small organic molecules
	- have molecular weights under 1000
	- exist as either weak acids or bases
	- diffuse through biological membranes in their uncharged form

## Physical factors affecting drug absorption
- blood flow to absorption site
	- e.g. blood flow to intestine is greater than flow to stomach, so intestine is favoured site of absorption
- surface area available
	- e.g. microvilli in intestine allow for greater absorption
- contact time at absorption surface
	- any condition that delays rate of passage of drug from the stomach to the GI tract (e.g., presence of food)
	- or increases its rate of passage through the GI (e.g., severe diarrhoea) 
		- reduces efficiency of absorption

# Bioavailability
- proportion of administered dose that is absorbed chemically unchanged into systemic circulation
- aka "fractional availability"
	- labelled as F
- bioavailability of IV administration is 100%

## Factors which affect bioavailability
- first pass hepatic metabolism
	- if rapidly metabolised by liver, less drug available
- solubility of drug
	- too hydrophilic and can't cross membranes
	- too hydrophobic and can't be carried by the blood
- chemical instability
	- susceptible to breaking down in stomach pH or degraded by enzymes in GI tract
- type of drug formulation
	- particle size, salt form, crystal polymorphism, binders and dispersing agents can influence ease of dissolution and rate of absorption

# Apparent volume of distribution (V<sub>D</sub>)
- hypothetical volume of fluid into which a drug can be disseminated
- determined by
	- partitioning across various membranes
		- size of the organ
		- capillary structure – e.g., blood-brain barrier, sealed with tight junctions
	- binding to tissue components (presence of non-active binding sites)
	- binding to blood components (RBC, plasma protein)
	- physiochemical properties of the drug – e.g., drug solubility, hydrophobic drugs
	- blood flow through the tissue physiological volumes

## Why is V<sub>D</sub> important?
- figure out concentration and location of drug in the body
- drugs with a large V<sub>D</sub> are distributed to tissues
- drugs with a small V<sub>D</sub> are confined to the blood
	- molecule is too large to leave
	- molecule binds more preferably to plasma proteins such as albumin
- you can also work backwards
	- V<sub>D</sub> is a constant
	- you can measure the plasma concentration
	- so you can therefore work out the total amount of drug in the body

# Plasma Binding Proteins
- act as a drug reservoir
	- albumin
	- alpha 1-acid glycoproteins
	- lipoproteins
	- beta globulin
- competition between drugs for protein binding
	- alters amount of drug available to bind to target
	- equilibrium between bound and free forms
- bound drugs are
	- non-diffusible
	- not metabolised
	- not excreted
