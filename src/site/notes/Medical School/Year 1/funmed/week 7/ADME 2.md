- [ ] Discuss drug accumulation
- [ ] Explain dosing regimens - loading vs maintenance dosing

# Metabolism
## Effects on Drugs
### Termination of Drug Action
- metabolised into inactive derivatives
### Activating of Drug Action
- prodrugs are administered whilst inactive, then activated by the metabolism
### Elimination without Metabolism
- excreted unchanged e.g. lithium
### Transactivation
- parent drug and metabolite have equivalent activity
	- activity of drug is prolonged
	- cheaper treatment

## Phases of Metabolism
### Phase 1 (Biotransformation - Degenerative)
- conversion of the drug into a water soluble metabolite
	- make the drug more polar
		- e.g. via oxidation from cytochrome (CYP)

#### CYP450 uses oxygen and NADPH to add a reactive group
- e.g. OH radical
- metabolite may be toxic if not further metabolised by Phase II conjugation
	- so if there's less phase II, increased risk of disease
CYP450 can also catalyse reduction reactions, but this is rarer

### Phase 2 (Conjugation - Synthetic)
- liver attaches large molecules to the drug to make it more water soluble
- occurs if the drug is not polar enough following phase 1
- most common conjugation reaction is with glucuronic acid

## Drug Metabolism Benefits
- detoxification
- understanding biotransformations allows us to make prodrugs
	- useful when drug is not lipid soluble so cannot enter cells

## Factors Affecting Drug Metabolism
- Diet
	- grapefruit juice inhibits CYP3A4
	- tobacco induces drug metabolism
- Drug-Drug interactions
	- inhibitors lead to overdose
	- inducers lead to underdose
- Diseases
	- liver and kidney diseases
- Ethnicity
	- P450 2D6 is inactive in some Caucasians, but hyperactive in some East Africans
- Age
	- speed of biotransformation affected
- Gender
	- women have a lower first pass metabolism compared with men

### Genetic Factors
- hydrolysis of esters
	- succinylcholine is hydrolysed by plasma cholinesterase rapidly (within 5 mins)
		- patients with mutated enzyme with slower rate of metabolism
			- leads to paralysis lasting for hours
- acetylation of amines
	- individuals who are "slow acetylators" will have prolonged or toxic effects to normal doses of these drugs

# Prodrugs in Cancer Therapy
- peptidyl spacers are designed fro plasma stability and intracellular cleavage
- some cancers have specific enzymes upregulated
	- so only cancer tissue will cleave groups
		- so the drug will only impact these cancer cells
- pH-sensitive spacers are triggered when entered acidic pH environment of the endosome and lysosome

# Elimination
- irreversible removal of a parent drug from the body
- renal excretion as drugs are filtered by the glomerulus
	- degree of ionisation of drug will impact this
		- depends on pH of urine, pKa of drug, and urine flow rate

## Renal Excretion
- urine pH is not constant (4.5-7.5)
- impacted by diet, drugs, and diseases

- methamphetamine is basic, so is excreted more in acidic urine
	- this is because the drug can be ionised, so cannot pass through cell membranes
		- and therefore cannot be reabsorbed into the blood

## Clearance
- the volume of body fluids containing the drug from which the drug is completely cleared per unit time

### Maintenance Dose of Drug
- Dosing Rate = Rate of Elimination = CL Ã— C

## Half-Life

### Increase Half-Life
- diminished renal plasma flow
- drugs competing with each other, displacing the first from albumin carrier protein
	- increases the volume of distribution of the drug
- decreased excretion ratio (renal disease)
- decreased metabolism
	- biotransformation inhibited or cirrhosis

# Dosage
## Dosage Regimen
- plan for drug administration to achieve therapeutic levels of drug in the blood
	- without exceeding the minimum toxic concentration
- without it, drug will be eliminated, so no therapeutic effect

## Loading Dose
![ADME 2-20241108114524262.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%207/attachments/ADME%202-20241108114524262.png)
- larger than normal dose
- gets to therapeutic range quicker for emergencies
- mainly for drugs with a large volume of distribution
## Maintenance Dose
- small fixed dose
- maintains drug in the therapeutic range
- elimination rate = maintenance dose rate

## Drug Accumulation
- when drug doses are repeated, the drug wiill accumulate until dosing stops
- shorter than 4 half lives between dosing leads to accumulation
- 5 half lives remove a drug from the system
