# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Be aware of different types of receptors as targets for ligand biding (Lipids, nucleic acids, proteins)
- [ ] Appreciate major classes of protein receptors (enzymes, carrier molecules, ion channels, transmembrane)
- [ ] Distinguish between various quantitative drug-receptor interactions (graded & quantal dose response curves)
- [ ] Explain what is meant by therapeutic index
- [ ] Differentiate between efficacy and potency
- [ ] Describe the relationship between receptor occupancy and spare receptors

# Drug Common Targets (receptors)
- GPCR take seconds
- kinase-linked receptors take minutes
- nuclear receptors take hours

## Lipids
- general anaesthetics
- these dissolve the membrane lipid, so membrane fluidity increases
	- influences the electrostatic potential
		- results in membrane disorder
- e.g. halothane, nitrous oxide

## DNA
- anti-tumour agents
- mitomycin covalently binds to DNA
	- prevents DNA replication & DNA degrading by free radical formation
- idoxuridine (thymidine analogue) can be phosphorylated and incorporated into DNA
	- inhibits viral replication
		- e.g. herpes, simplex, shingles

## Proteins
### Ligand-gated Ion Channels
- ionotropic receptors work in milliseconds
- transmembrane proteins found at cell surface
- open in response to binding of a neurotransmitter at the binding pocket
	- acetylcholine, 5-HT, glutamate, GABA, ATP
- ligands are neurotransmitters - cations are excitatory and anions are inhibitory
	- Na+ influx- depolarises cell: Nicotinic AChR (neuronal excitation)
	- Ca2+ influx- depolarises cell: Glutamate (NMDA) (neuronal excitation)
	- Cl- influx- hyperpolarises cell: GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid) (neuronal inhibition)

### GPCRs
- •β-adrenoceptors make the heart beat faster and stronger
- histamine receptors bring about the contraction of smooth muscle
- dopamine receptors have roles in the central nervous system and in motor control
- Enzyme-linked Receptors
	- formed by transmembrane protein
		- with ligand-binding outside
		- and enzyme-binding site inside

### Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs)
- formed of three parts
	- extracellular binding domain
	- transmembrane helical region
	- intracellular domain (enzymatic)
		- activates downstream signalling cascades
- these have an effect on a transcriptional level
- e.g. herceptin
	- binds to HER2 receptor
		- prevents receptor dimerisation 
			- stops the following signals for leukaemia

### Nuclear Receptors
- activated by steroid/hormone ligands within the cytoplasm
- take hours
![pharmacodynamics-20241106103211644.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%207/attachments/pharmacodynamics-20241106103211644.png)
- binding of ligand causes ligand-binding domain of receptor to clamp shut
- co-activator proteins to bind to the receptor's transcription-activating domain
	- increasing gene transcription

# Quantitative outcomes of drug-receptor interactions
- direct measurement of the direct consequence of drug action
	- blood pressure
	- rate of urine production
	- changes in blood glucose levels
	- contraction/relaxation of smooth muscle in organ bath

## Graded dose-responsive curves
- concentration-effect graphs / dosage-effect graphs
- should not be used to measure affinity of drug for receptor
	- as occupancy and response are not always directly proportional
	- we won't know how much of the drug actually made it to a receptor

## Quantal (population) dose response curves
- all or nothing response
- proportion of individuals responding varies with dosage
- gives a normal distribution
- can be used to work out lethal doses (LD<sub>50</sub>) and effective doses (ED<sub>50</sub>)

# Therapeutic Index
TI = Lethal dose<sub>(chosen %)</sub> / Effective dose<sub>(chosen %)</sub>
- drugs with a narrow TI are difficult to use clinically and will require monitoring of plasma concentration to prevent toxicity

# Factors related to drug specificity
- efficacy
	- **ability or strength** of a single drug-receptor complex in evoking a response in tissue
		- this applies only to agonists (efficacy is zero in antagonists)
- potency
	- the **dose** of drug required to produce a given effect
- affinity
	- the ability of a ligand to **bind to a receptor**
		- applies to both agonists and antagonists, measured by the equilibrium dissociation constant Kd

efficacy and affinity combine to give us the potency
- high potency needs large affinity and efficacy
![pharmacodynamics-20241106104805789.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%207/attachments/pharmacodynamics-20241106104805789.png)
(P = protein, L = ligand)
Kd: The concentration of a drug that results in binding to 50% of the receptors
The lower Kd value, the higher the receptor affinity
BUT – a Kd of 0 = no drug at that receptor

## Binding Pocket
- aka the ligand binding site
- bonding and release of substances at the binding pocket results in an equilibrium
- competition between molecules within one ligand binding site
- drugs with high affinity with the binding pocket will have intermolecular forces changing the shape of the binding pockets to best favour it (basically the induced fit concept)

## Potency vs Efficacy
- efficacy is E<sub>max</sub>
	- maximum effect from a drug, so increasing dosage will not increase effect
- potency is the concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) or dose (ED<sub>50</sub>) of a drug required to produce 50% of that drug’s maximal effect

## Occupancy
- the proportion of receptors bound to ligand

## Spare Receptors
- all receptors do not have to be occupied to reach E<sub>max</sub> 
- increase both sensitivity and speed of a tissue's responsiveness to a ligand
	- more receptors just means a higher chance of a ligand binding after all
- if receptor availability is reduced
	- i.e. through desensitisation or down-regulation
		- these spare receptors will mean that the maximal response will not be affected
