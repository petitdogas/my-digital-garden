# Learning Objectives
- [ ] List a variety of pharmacological terms and define them (including agonist, partial agonist, antagonist)
- [ ] Explain what a drug receptor is and how they are involved in drug function
- [ ] Give examples of drugs that are solid, liquid or gaseous at room temperature
- [ ] Give examples of drugs with small and large molecular weights
- [ ] Describe the different chemical bonds involved in drug action
- [ ] Explain the effect of drug's pKa and pH of environment on pharmacokinetics
- [ ] Differentiate selectivity from specificity
- [ ] Describe how drug names can yield information on function

# Definitions
- Clinical pharmacology
	- the scientific study of drug effects in humans
- Therapeutics
	- the branch of medicine concerned with the treatment of disease
- Toxicology
	- the study of the undesirable effects of chemical agents on living systems
- Drug receptor
	- the molecular component of the body with which a drug interacts to bring about its effects

# Pharmacodynamics

## Competitive Interactions
### Agonists
- bind to receptors and activate them, mimicking the action of the natural ligand
	- when ligand leaves the receptor, effect stops
		- some receptors are permanently activated

### Partial Agonists
- bind to receptor at active site
- lower affinity to receptor and do not bind as strongly as full agonists
- unable to cause maximal response even if all receptors are used
- prevents other agonists from binding

### Antagonists

#### Competitive Antagonist
- fits into active site but does not activate receptor
- reduce agonist potency

#### Non-competitive Antagonist
- binds to a different site
- modulates function of receptor
- reduce agonist efficacy

#### Chemical Antagonist
- binds directly to the agonist
- prevents agonist from binding to receptor or substrate
- [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 1/sugars and polysaccharides#Heparin and Heparan Sulfate\|heparin]] & protamine

#### Physiological Antagonist
- two drugs have exactly opposite actions via different pathways

# Pharmacokinetics
- what the body does to the drug
- **Liberation** - the way a drug is released from its administered form
- **Absorption** - how a drug travels from site of release to site of action
- **Distribution** - passage of a drug through the bloodstream to different tissues
- **Metabolism** - enzymatic activities which break down a drug
- **Excretion** - elimination of a drug from the body

# Pharmacogenomics
- refers to genetic variability causing variations in the delivery/removal of drug from sites of action
- problematic for drugs with a narrow therapeutic range/window
	- small differences may result in therapeutic failure or toxicity
- â€¢e.g. succinylcholine
	- Caucasians have enzyme 1,000-fold reduced affinity, so slower elimination

# Receptors
- membrane attached proteins which act as the target for several biomolecules like hormones
- drugs can interact with these receptors

# Size and Molecular Mass of Drug
- small molecules of 7-900 Da
	- rapidly diffuse across cell membranes and reach intracellular sites of action
- large molcules
	- ~3000-150000 Da
	- normally require injections

# Drug-Receptor Bonds
- very strong covalent
	- irreversible
- weaker ionic / electrostatic
- very weak interactions (hydrogen, London, hydrophobic)

# Weak Acids and Bases

# Specificity vs Selectivity
## Specificity
- ability of a drug to bind to **one** receptor
## Selectivity
- ability of a drug to selectively produce a specific **effect**
- vast majority of drugs are selective rather than specific
- affected by
	- physiochemical properties of the drug
	- genetic make-up, sex, age, comorbidities
	- dose administered and route thereof

# Drug Classification
- chemical classification
- physiological effect classification
- therapeutic classification
- legal classification

## Nomenclature
- use generic name as there are lots of brand names
