# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Outline features of the genetic code
- [ ] What are the essential RNA species for translation
- [ ] Understand the role of the ribosome in mRNA translation; how and where, including co-translational translocation of the membrane and secreted peptides at the ER
- [ ] How does viral and bacterial interference affect protein translation
- [ ] Know that antibiotics are used to target ribosomes
- [ ] Outline protein synthesis defects in inherited disease

# The Genetic Code
- There are 20 different amino acids
- Start codon is {{ATG/AUG}}
- Stop codons are
	- {{TAA / TGA / TAG}}
	- {{UAA / UGA / UAG}}
<!--SR:!2000-01-01,1,130!2024-10-13,2,152!2024-10-13,2,150-->

## Degeneracy
- 64 possible combinations but only 20 amino acids, so lots of combinations for same amino acids
- There is codon usage bias

## Initiation and Reading Frames
- Read from 5’ to 3’
- Always write from N terminal
- [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 2/causes of genetic mutations#Frameshift Mutations\|Frameshifting]] mutations occur

# Types of RNA

## mRNA
- Synthesised by transcription and then spliced into mature mRNA
- Carries genetic information from the DNA
## rRNA
- Acts to help catalyse protein synthesis
## tRNA
- Converts the mRNA message into amino acids
### Structure
- L shaped 3D fold

Aminoacyl tRNA

### Function
- Acts to translate between RNA and amino acid
- One end is attached to a specific amino acid
	- Attachment is catalysed by {{**aminoacyl tRNA synthetase**}}
- The other end has the anticodon

#### Aminoacyl tRNA synthetase
- Links amino acid to their cognate tRNAs

#### Wobble
??
- 64 possible codons, but not 64 different tRNAs
	- A single tRNA can recognise multiple codons
- Once the first two bases are paired, the third one is less important
	- Third base can pair with either a purine or pyrimidine
		- This is called wobble

# Translation
## Initiation
- Small ribosomal subunit binds to AUG
- Specific initiator tRNA (tRNAi<sup>Met</sup>) carrying a {{methionine}} binds to the AUG
- The large ribosomal subunit (60S) binds to this complex
- tRNA occupies the {{P site}}

## Elongation
- tRNA with complementary anticodon binds to the mRNA
	- mRNA occupies the {{A site}} in the ribosome
- Peptide bond formation
- Cleaving of bond between the amino acid and first tRNA
- Translocation
	- Ribosome shifts forwards one codon in the mRNA (5’ to 3’)
- Empty tRNA moves from {{P site to E site}}
	- A site is now empty and ready for another tRNA
	- Uncharged tRNA is released from E site
## Termination
- Ribosome reaches stop codon
	- UAG, UAA, UGA
- Polypeptide released from ribosome
- tRNA released from ribosome
- Ribosomal subunits dissociate from the mRNA
