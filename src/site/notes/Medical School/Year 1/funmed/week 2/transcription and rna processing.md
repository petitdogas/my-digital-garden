# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Understand the differences between coding and non-coding DNA sequences, introns and exons, and control elements
- [ ] Understand the importance of gene expression for cellular identity
- [ ] Appreciate the crucial role mRNA synthesis plays in this
- [ ] Be able to describe the basic steps that create lead to translatable mRNA in the cytoplasm
- [ ] Recognise that aberrant gene expression is a major cause of disease

# Structure of a Gene
- Free phosphate group at the 5' position of the sugar backbone
- Unlinked OH group at the 3' position of the sugar backbone
- start codon AUG
- exons coding introns non-coding
- control elements
	- sequences such as promoters and enhancers that regulate transcription

# RNA polymerases
- RNA synthesised in the {{5' to 3' direction}}
- DNA template read in the {{3' to 5' direction}}

## Steps in mRNA synthesis
### initiation
- once DNA unwinds close to a gene, RNA polymerase binds to a promoter sequence
- **{{preinitiation complex}}** brings the pol II to the right area of the gene
	- TATA box
	- upstream and downstream elements that bind positive and negatively acting transcription factors, called enhancers and silencers.
### elongation
- RNA polymerase synthesises complementary RNA in the 5’ to 3’ direction, using NTPs {{(ribonucleoside triphosphates)}}

### processing

#### Alternative Splicing of mRNA
- production of {{isoenzymes}} from one gene
	- use different exons

### termination
- RNA polymerase reaches terminator sequence, transcription stops, messenger RNA (mRNA) is released
- polyadenylated transcript is cleaved
### export
- nuclear pores are large macromolecular assemblies that span the nuclear envelope
	- function as a barrier to molecules larger than 40kDa
	- export receptors recognise nuclear export signals that are present in proteins bound to RNA during transcription and splicing

# Examples of Mis-regulated Gene Expression and Disease
## General transcription factors
- cMyc is one of the most common mutated oncogenes
## Mutated splice sites
- cancer (BRCA1 and 2)
- spinal muscular atrophy (SMN2)
- atypical cystic fibrosis (CFTR)
## Mutated splicing machinery
- retinitis pigmentosa
- spinal muscular atrophy
