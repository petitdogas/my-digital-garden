- [ ] Understand the basic principles of population genetics
- [ ] Explain how genetic variation contributes to common disease

# Inheritance of Genetic Diseases

Penetrance;; - the extent to which a particular gene or set of genes is expressed in the phenotypes of individuals carrying it, measured by the proportion of carriers showing the characteristic phenotype.
## Mendelian or Monogenic
- determined by a single gene
- e.g. CFTR - cystic fibrosis

### Autosomal Dominant
- appears in homozygous dominant / heterozygous
- affected person has at least one affected parent
- affects either sex equally
- can be trasnmitted by either parent
	- Huntington's disease
	- [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 1/extracellular matrix and cell adhesion#Marfan Syndrome\|Marfan Syndrome]]
	- Neurofibromatosis type 1
	- Polycystic kidney disease

#### Complications
- sporadic de novo cases
- variable penetrance
	- {{genetic background of individual may be asymptomatic}}
- variable expressivity
	- variation in severity of symptoms
- anticipation
	- {{disease manifests at a younger age in successive generations}}
		- e.g. Huntington's disease

### Autosomal Recessive
- affected people can be born to unaffected parents
	- parents are carriers
	- either gender affected equally
- Examples
	- Phenylketonuria (PKU)
	- [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 2/causes of genetic mutations#Tay Sachs Disease\|Tay Sachs disease]]
	- [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 2/causes of genetic mutations#Sickle Cell Disease\|Sickle cell disease]]
	- Cystic fibrosis
### X-linked Dominant
- if father affected, male children are spared
- if mother is affected, trait passed to both boys and girls
- Examples
	- Goltz syndrome
	- X-linked porphyria
	- Rett syndrome
	- Fragile X syndrome
### X-linked Recessive
- father is never affected nor is a carrier
	- no father to son transmission as mother is the carrier
- usually affects son
- daughter can be affected if father affected and mother is carrier
	- or due to non-random X-inactivation
- Examples
	- haemophilia A and B
	- Hunter syndrome
	- Duchenne and Becker MD
### Y-linked
- only father to son transmission
- very rare as only 100 genes on Y chromosome and most are involved in male sexual characteristics
- affected individuals are **hemizygotes**
	- only one allele is required for disease

## Multifactorial
- small number of genes with a moderate effect
	- {{oligogenic trait}}
- large number of genes with individually small effect
	- {{polygenic}}
- may be triggered by environmental factors
## Complex
- large number of genes and environmental factors
	- e.g. diet, stress, smoking as well as genes
		- diabetes, cancer, coronary heart disease
