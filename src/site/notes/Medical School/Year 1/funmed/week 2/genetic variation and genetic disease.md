# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Appreciate how much genetic variation we have: both rare and common variants
- [ ] Discuss how DNA polymorphisms can be detected and how they may be used to identify individuals
- [ ] Understand how prenatal diagnosis and PGD can be performed
- [ ] Appreciate how genetic variation may determine treatment options
- [ ] Think about the ethical issues with respect to personal genome sequencing

# Detecting Genetic Variation
## Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
??
- used to amplify a region of the genome using template DNA and specific primers
- denaturation (94C)
- annealing (54C)
- extension (72C)

## Sanger Sequencing
??
- add dideoxynucleotides with a fluorescent tag
	- stop synthesis of DNA when the dDNA is added
		- each nucleotide has a different colour
			- run through gel and pass electrical current to separate fragments
				- largest at top of the gel
					- read down the DNA sequence

## Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)
??
- sequencing of the whole exome
- sequencing of the whole genome
- RNA sequencing
this produces way too much data (terabytes) which we compare with a good database with strong ethical guidance and legal frameworks

# Molecular Diagnosis and Targeted Therapy
- personalised medicine
- selection of embroys prior to IVF
- personalised targeted therapies for cancer patients

## Pharmacogenomics

## Gene Therapy
- Gene therapy is broadly a series of techniques (many of them experimental) that use genes to treat or prevent diseases (e.g. inherited gene disorders, cancers, and certain viral infections).

### Gene transfer
- insertion of a normal copy of a gene into a cell
### Stem cell therapy
- human stem cells used to repair/replace disease-damaged tissue
### RNA modification therapy
- silences mRNA transcripts encoded by the mutant gene
### Gene Editing
- targeted knockout and corrective replacement of mutations using engineered endonucleases
	- CRISPR-Cas9

# Ethical Issues

When is it ethical to offer genetic testing or screening?
  -  what do the results mean?
  -  do you have proper genetic counselling service available?
  - what about confidentiality and data protection (insurance companies)?
What about pre-natal screening?
   - is post-screening abortion an option? Should it be?
   - Should embryos be screened prior to implantation?
What about young adults wanting to be tested for future possible diseases?
  -  how predictive are the tests?
  -   is a cure/prevention actually available?
What about genome editing? Is it ethical/moral?
