# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Define the term epigenetics
- [ ] Describe the role of epigenetics marks in controlling gene expression
- [ ] Understanding the extent to which epigenetics impacts on human disease
# Multigenerational, intergenerational and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance
## In Females
- affect F1 and F2 directly
	- multigenerational
- F3 indirectly
	- transgenerational
## In Males
- germ cells are not produced in the developing foetus
- effect in F1 is direct
	- multigenerational
- effect in F2 is indirect exposure
	- transgenerational

# Barker Hypothesis
- thrifty phenotype
	- if a baby was born to a mother with a nutrient-poor diet, baby born underweight
		- if you follow them into an environment with lots of excess calories
			- these individuals ended up with metabolic diseases
				- cardiovascular diseases, strokes, diabetes

# Chromatin Architecture
- changes shape of histone
	- ATP-dependent remodelling complexes regulate gene expression
		- alter the contact between DNA and histones
		- alter the path of the DNA as it winds around histones
		- alter the structure of the nucleosome core

# Histone Modification
- post-translational modification of histones
	- acetylation
	- methylation
	- phosphorylation
	- ubiquitylation
- these modifications are on {{lysine (K)}}

H is histone, K is amino acid, number of subunits
	- H3K4me3 - histone 3 amino acid four has three methyl groups added
	- H3K36me3 - histone 3 amino acid 36 has three methyl groups added

## Acetylation
??
- histone acetylase (HAT)
	- associated with more open and accessible DNA
	- puts acetyl group on the histone tails
- histone deacetylase (HDAC)
	- removes acetyl groups
		- vacant site can then be methylated
		- or interactions between existing methyl groups increased

### HDAC inhibitors
- used to increase gene transcription for some genetic disorders
- could also be used to modify epigenetic changes

# DNA Methylation
- DNA {{methyltransferase}} (DNMT)
	- methylates {{cytosine (5-methyl-cytosine)}}
		- stops gene from being expressed
- CpG sites rich in cytosine, guanine, cytosine, guanine....
	- typically found in promoter regions

Methylation patterns are tissue specific and heritable

# Global hypomethyaltion with focal hypermethylation in cancer development
- normal genome is usually {{hypermethylated}} and stable
	- with age, you lose some methyl groups
		- hypomethylation
- CpG-island specific DNA hypermethylation of tumour suppressant genes
	- cancer

# non-coding RNAs
- miRNA
- siRNA
- piRNA
- lncRNA
- they block RNA being translated into proteins
