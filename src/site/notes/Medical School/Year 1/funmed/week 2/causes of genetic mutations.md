# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Understand the mechanisms that generate different types of genetic mutations
- [ ] Understand how mutations affect the organism
- [ ] Identify the causes of spontaneous mutations
- [ ] Understand the DNA modifications which occur to generate mutations

# Types of Mutation
- Genomic changes
	- aneuploidy
- Chromosomal changes/rearrangements
	- [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 2/human genome and chromosomes#Robertsonian Translocation\|translocations]]
	- visible structural changes in the chromosome
## Gene mutations
- single base pair changes / few bases

### Point Mutations
- silent mutation
- nonsense mutation
	- early stop codon
- missense mutation
	- conservative vs non-conservative
	- different amino acid coded for
		- conservative when the different amino acid has a similar chemistry, so not as severe consequences

#### Sickle Cell Disease
- non-conservative missense A to T
	- glutamic acid to valine
- crystallisation of haemoglobin at low oxygen concentration
	- results in sickling of cells
		- RBCs stick together and get stuck in small blood vessels
			- vaso occlusive crisis

### Frameshift Mutations
- base insertion/deletion so each codon is off by one
	- wrong amino acid coded for
		- protein does not function properly

#### Tay Sachs Disease
- autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease
- b-hexosaminidase A mutation found on chromosome 15
	- mutation found in significant proportion of Ashkenazi Jews
	- enzyme does not function correctly
		- so GM2 ganglioside is not broken down
			- therefore increased {{concentration of gangliosides}} inside nerve cells
				- nerve cells die

most of the mutations in Hex A are actually point mutations
		BUT
there are 8 frameshift mutations
- 6 deletions, 2 insertions

## Chromosomal Mutations

### Deletion
#### Cri du chat
- partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5
- sporadic and de novo deletions most common
#### Di George syndrome
- microdeletion of region of long arm of chromosome 22
- mostly de novo deletions

### Duplication
#### Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT1A)
- majority of cases duplication of large region of short arm of chromosome 17
- includes gene peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22)
	- pes cavus
		- high arch of foot that does not flatten with weightbearing
			- due to affect of disease on nerves

### Translocation
#### XX male syndrome
- translocation of SRY gene from Y chromosome to X chromosome

### Chromosomal Nondisjunction
- chromosomes don't separate properly during anaphase
	- both sister chromatids/homologous chromosomes are pulled to the same pole of cell
		- trisomy/monosomy/triploidy
mitotic nondisjunction can occur due to the inactivation of topoisomerase II

#### [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 2/human genome and chromosomes#Klinefelter Syndrome (47,XXY)\|Klinefelters Syndrome]]

#### [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 2/human genome and chromosomes#Turner syndrome (45,X)\|Turner Syndrome]]


# What causes genetic mutations?

## Spontaneous Mutations
- occur naturally due to the natural error rate for DNA polymerase
- occur during S, G1, or G2
- many mutatinons are corrected by cellular repair systems

### Tautomeric shift (base substitution)
- all bases have **tautomers** (isomers)
	- C and A are commonly in {{amino form, and rarely **imino**}}
	- G and T are commonly in {{keto form, and rarely **enol**}}
		- these tautomers can lead to {{**transition mutations**}}
			- different purine/pyrimidine, so mismatched base pairs

### Depurination (deletion)
??
- spontaneous cleavage of bond between base and deoxyribose
	- A or G

### Deamination (base substitution)****
??
- removal of NH3 group through hydrolysis hydrolysis reaction
	- cystosine --> uracil
