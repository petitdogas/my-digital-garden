# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Describe the structure and organisation of the human genome
- [ ] Define the terms used to denote variation in chromosome number and structure
- [ ] Outline the genetics and clinical features of the common aneuploidy syndromes, and methods for prenatal diagnosis
- [ ] Describe the functions of the X and Y chromosomes and outline the process of X-inactivation

# Chromosome Organisation
![human genome and chromosomes-20240930100849736.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%202/attachments/human%20genome%20and%20chromosomes-20240930100849736.png)
chromosome number one

- karyotypes are just how we organise chromosomes
	- artifical arrangement, staining, and photgraphy of chromosomes in size order
	- 1-22 are autosomes
	- 23 are sex chromosomes

# Variation in Chromosome Number (Aneuploidy)
- polyploidy - gain of one or more haploid sets
	- triploid is therefore 69,XXX or 69,XXY, or 69,XYY
- polysomy - gain of onre or more chromosomes
	- trisomy is therefore three copies of a chromosome
		- Downs syndrome is chromosome 21

# Robertsonian Translocation
- chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22 are acrocentric chromosomes
	- centromeres located at the end of the chromosome instead of centre
		- two long arms of acrocentric chromosomes join at their centromeres
			- therefore the entire chromosome joins the other (short arms are lost)

# Syndromes due to chromosome number
## Autosome (mainly maternally derived)
### Down Syndrome {{(trisomy 21)}}
- ~30% miscarriage
- upward slanting eyes
- marked muscle hypotonia as babies
- single palmar crease
- congenital heart malformations
- early onset Alzheimer's - gene for amyloid precursor protein (APP)

#### Causes
- 95% have three separate copies of chromosome 21
- 4% have extra copy because of {{a Robertsonian translocation between 14 and 21}}
- 1% have mosaicism
	- some cells have three copies of chromosome 21
		- other cells have two copies
			- therefore usually milder symptoms
			- caused by non-disjunction

association with increasing maternal age
- increased chromosomal missegregation

### Edwards Syndrome {{(trisomy 18)}}
- 1 in 300 births
- multiple malformations (heart, kidneys)
- clenched hands with overlapping fingers

### Patau Syndrome {{(trisomy 13)}}
- 1 in 5000 births
- multiple malformations
- affects midline structures particularly
	- incomplete lobation of brain; cleft lip; congenital heart disease
## Sex chromosomes

### Klinefelter Syndrome {{(47,XXY)}}
- 1 in 1000 males
- infertility (atrophic testes do not produce sperm)
- lack of testosterone - poorly developed secondary sexual characteristics
- tall

### Turner syndrome {{(45,X)}}
- 1 in 5000 females
- short stature
- primary {{amenorrhoea}} (ovaries involute before birth)
- 20% have congenital heart disease
	- coarctation of aorta â€“ localised narrowing and thickening
## All chromosomes
- Iriploidy (69 chromosomes) - most embryos will miscarry


# Prenatal Screening
![human genome and chromosomes-20240930103848876.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%202/attachments/human%20genome%20and%20chromosomes-20240930103848876.png)

# X-inactivation
- X-chromosomes contain about 1100 genes
- in females, one X can be inactivated early in embryonic development
	- therefore one X chromosome inactivated in adult somatic cells
![human genome and chromosomes-20240930104130677.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%202/attachments/human%20genome%20and%20chromosomes-20240930104130677.png)

- Xist is a long non-coding RNA which is encoded in the X-Inactivation Centre (XIC) on the X-chromosome
- Xist associates closely with the X-chromosome from which it is expressed
- This leads to chromatin changes and spatial reorganisation of the chromosome, leading to transcriptional inactivation
- X-inactivation is reversed only in the germ cells

# Y-chromosome
- variable size, but roughly 100 genes
	- SRY gene - sex determining region of the Y chromosome
		- encodes for {{HMG transcription factor}} responsible for male characteristics
