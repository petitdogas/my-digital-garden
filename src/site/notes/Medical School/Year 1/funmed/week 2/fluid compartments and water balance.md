# Learning Objectives

# Body Fluid Compartments
## Intracellular fluid (40% of body weight)
- 2/3 of total water
- consists of cytosol and fluid in the cell nucleus
- water solvent with K+ and PO4 3- and large amounts of proteins
- little Na+ and Cl-
- almost no Ca2+
## Extracellular fluid (20% of body weight)
### Interstitial Fluid
- 15% of body weight
- represents approximately 75% of ECF
- Na+ HCO3 - Cl-
### Plasma
- about 5% of body weight
- water solvent containing products of digestion, hormones, electrolytes, waste products and plasma proteins
- Na+ HCO3 - Cl-

# Body Fluid Compartment Barriers
## Cell Plasma Membrane
- physical barrier separating ICF and ISF
## Capillary Endothelium
- physical barrier that separates the interstitial fluid (ISF) from plasma at the capillary level

# Water Movement Between Compartments
- across the plasma membrane across aquaporins

Two major driving forces for water movement within the body:
1) Hydrostatic pressure: the effect of gravity on the fluid across capillary endothelial cells
2) Osmotic pressure: the pressure needed to stop osmosis across a semi-permeable membrane, i.e. the pressure that would have to be applied to a pure solvent to prevent it from passing into a given solution by osmosis

## Osmolarity and Osmolality
- ECF and ICF have the same osmolality/osmolarity under normal conditions
### Osmolarity
- the measure of total solute concentration expressed as the number of osmoles (Osm) of solute per litre (L) of solution (Osm/L or mOsm/L)
- affected by pressure and temperature

Molarity (M)x dissociation number (N)Â x osmotic coefficient

### Osmolality
- the measure of total solute concentration expressed as the number of the osmoles (Osm) of solute per kilogram (Kg) of solvent (Osm/Kg or mOsm/Kg)
- unaffected by pressure and temperature

## Tonicity
- depends on whether the solutes in the solution are permeant or non-permeant
- net water movement will be into the compartment that has the higher concentration of non-penetrating solutes

- isotonic stay same
- hypertonic cell shrinks
- hypotonic cell swells

# Disturbances in fluid balance in body compartments
- change in volume first affects the ECF
	- this then impacts the ICF
- at equilibrium, ECF and ICF have same osmolality

## Volume Contraction

## Volume Expansion

# Water Regulation

## ADH Disorders
### ADH deficiency

#### Hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal lesions (central diabetes insipidus)
- excessive dilute urine
- dehydration, hyperosmolality, hypovolemia

### ADH excess
#### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)
- too much water retention
	- reduced plasma osmolality
	- reduced concentrated urine
- water retention, hypoosmolality and hyponatremia

## Roles of Aldosterone
- Aldosterone is released from the adrenal cortex when:
	- {{reduced Na+ (hyponatremia)}}
	- {{increased K+ (hyperkalemia)}}
	- {{low blood volume}}
- aldosterone acts on the {{epithelial sodium channels (ENaC)}} in the collecting tubules and causes sodium reabsorption
### Aldosterone Disorders
#### Hyperaldosteronism
- increased reabsorption of sodium and volume expansion
#### Addison disease
- severe dehydration, hyponatraemia

## Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)
