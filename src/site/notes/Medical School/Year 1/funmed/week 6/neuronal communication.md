# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Describe the roles of ions and ion channels in:
1. The resting membrane potential
2. The action potential
- [ ] Describe action potential propagation
- [ ] Explain neurotransmitter release at the pre-synaptic terminal
- [ ] Describe neurotransmitter action at the post-synaptic neurone

# Maintenance of resting potential
## Passive ion facilitated diffusion
- leaky channels
- more K+ leaky channels than Na + leaky channels
	- membrane is therefore more permeable to K+
		- ions move from intracellular to extracellular
- this slows down as the electrical force increases
- essentially, losing more K+ than gaining Na+, so inside of cell has a more negative potential
## Active transport of ions
- action of the sodium-potassium ATPase pump
- 3 Na+ from intracellular exchanged for 2 K+ from extracellular 
	- therefore, higher Na+ concentration in extracellular
	- higher K+ in intracellular
	- therefore, extracellular more positive than intracellular
## Gibbs-Donnan equilibrium effect
- presence of a charged permeant ion on one side of a membrane
	- e.g. protein
- results in asymmetric distribution of permeant charged ions
# Voltage-gated ion channels
## Voltage-sensitive Na+ channels
- contain 2 gates
	- activation gate closed in resting state
	- inactivation gate open in resting state
- activation gate opens in response to depolarisation
- inactivation gate closes in response to depolarisation
- after repolarisation, return to resting state

## Voltage-sensitive K+ channels
- open in response to depolarisation
- open at the peak of the action potential
- increases permeability of the membrane to K+
	- K+ flows out of cell, causing decrease in action potential
		- hyperpolarisation

# Neurotransmitter release
- active zones
	- arrays of Ca2+ channels
- vesicle docking
- [[Medical School/Year 1/loco/week 2/neuromuscular junction#Vesicle Docking and Acetylcholine Release - SNARE complex\|SNARE]] complex
	- anchors vesicles to the cytoskeleton
	- priming
- Ca2+ enters
	- vesicles fuse with membrane to release contents

# Types of receptors on the post-synaptic cell membrane

| Ligand-gated ion channels                                                                 | G protein coupled receptors                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| receptors found at cell surface                                                           | located in the membrane and recognise<br>external signals                   |
| ligand binds to the receptor and opens a <br>channel in the membrane                      | activation of a receptor activates a<br>wide range of intracellular effects |
| they function as a pore in the membrane<br>to allow ions to flow into and out of the cell | this can include opening or closing<br>voltage gated ion channels           |
|                                                                                           |                                                                             |
## Ligand-gated ion channels
- ion flux changes
	- depolarisation (nAChR) (Na+; neuronal excitation)
	- hyperpolarisation GABA<sub>A</sub> (gamma aminobutyric acid) (Cl-; neuronal inhibition)
	- Ca2+ influx- processes sensitive to Ca2+
## G protein coupled receptors
- in resting state, GPCR linked to an enzyme called a G protein
- ligand binds to GPCR
- activates downstream signals
- one role of GPCRs is to open/close ion channels
