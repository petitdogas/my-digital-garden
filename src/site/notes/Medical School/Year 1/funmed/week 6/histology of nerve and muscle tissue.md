# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Draw a neuron and label its key histological and structural features

- [ ] Identify the types of glial cells in both the CNS and PNS, their structures, and their functions
- [ ] Given a histological image, students should be able to identify skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle
- [ ] Given an image of a cross-section of skeletal muscle, students should be able to label muscle cells, endomysium and perimysium
- [ ] Given a histological image of cardiac muscle, students should be able to identify and explain the function of intercalated discs
- [ ] Given a histological image of smooth muscle, students should be able to determine the direction of contraction
- [ ] Given an electron micrograph of a skeletal or cardiac muscle cell, students should be able to label the components of the sarcomere

# Glial Cells
- neuroglial cells (glia )are supporting non-conducting cells that are close to  the neurone

##  four types in CNS:
###  oligodendrocytes
- myelination of cells in the CNS
- myelinate multiple sections of an axon and mulitiple axons
### [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 6/introduction to the central nervous system#Astrocytes\|astrocytes]]
- supporting cells, regulating the metabolic environment around neurone also forms part of blood brain barrier
### microglia
- equivalent of macrophages as phagocytic cells normally quiescent
### ependymal cells (central neuroglia)
-  line the ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord produce and move the cerebrospinal fluid
## in PNS:
### Schwann cells
- myelinating cells which insulate the axon to prevent signal loss and increase speed of conduction
### satellite cells
- support cells around sensory neurone cell bodies
### peripheral neuroglia

# Neurones

![histology of nerve and muscle tissue-20241028100119513.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/histology%20of%20nerve%20and%20muscle%20tissue-20241028100119513.png)
## Types of Neurones
### Bipolar
- single dendrite that extends from the cell body, opposite the side from which the single axon extends
### Pseudounipolar
- •single axon that splits into two branches
	- one branch that runs to the peripheral tissues
	- one branch that leads to the spinal cord
![histology of nerve and muscle tissue-20241028100613366.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/histology%20of%20nerve%20and%20muscle%20tissue-20241028100613366.png)
### Multipolar
- has multiple dendrites extending from the cell body and a single axon extending in the opposite direction

# Peripheral Nerve and Connective Tissue
- peripheral nerves are made up of numerous nerve fibres grouped into fascicles embedded in connective tissue
	- epineurium surrounds all fascicles
	- perineurium surrounds individual fascicles
	- endoneurium surrounds individual nerve fibres
![histology of nerve and muscle tissue-20241028101337830.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/histology%20of%20nerve%20and%20muscle%20tissue-20241028101337830.png)

# Types of Muscle
![histology of nerve and muscle tissue-20241028102649975.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/histology%20of%20nerve%20and%20muscle%20tissue-20241028102649975.png)
## Skeletal Muscle
- striated
- large with nuclei located around periphery 
- myofibrils span length of cell
- repeated and regular arrangement of actin and myosin
## (Sarcomeres)
- functional unit of myofibrils
	- run from Z-disc to Z-disc
	- actin attaches to Z-disc and extend towards the centre of the sarcomere
	- myosin filaments sit in the centre and span the A-band – myosin held in place by M-line proteins
	- I-band mainly actin plus the Z-disc between sarcomeres
- when muscle contracts, myosin attaches to actin and pulls it towards the centre
	- reduces the I-band length
- T-tubules
	- invagination of the cell membrane
- Sarcoplasmic reticulum
	- stores calcium

## Cardiac Muscle
- one or two centrally located nuclei
- surrounded by numerous capillaries
- abundance of mitochondria
- intercalated discs join cardiac muscle cells from end-to-end
	- provide anchorage for myofibrils and allow rapid spread of contractile stimuli between cells
	- stain darkly and are oriented at right angles to the muscle fibres
![histology of nerve and muscle tissue-20241028102056133.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/histology%20of%20nerve%20and%20muscle%20tissue-20241028102056133.png)
three types of cell-cell contacts:
- adhering junction – connected to actin filaments and transmit contraction
- desmosomes – connect to intermediate filaments and provide mechanical support to the cell
- gap junctions – allow ions (current) to spread between adjacent cells – allowing cardiac muscle to contract in coordinated manner

## Smooth Muscle
- arrangement is different between organs
- spindle-shaped individual cells
	- groups oriented in one direction to provide contraction in that direction
- myosin and actin scattered throughout sarcoplasm
	- attached to dense bodies on cell membrane and within cytoplasm
	- not arranged in myofibrils make smooth muscle appear smooth (no striations)
	- when contracting, the myosin pulls actin attached to dense bodies closer, causing cell to shrink
