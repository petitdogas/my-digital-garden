# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Describe the uses of, and the differences between:
- Plain (X-ray) radiographs/films (DEXA scans)
- Computerised tomography (CT)
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
- Ultrasound (Doppler)
- [ ] Discuss why knowledge of anatomy is vital to appreciate the applications of imaging to medicine
- [ ] Discuss the use of contrast: barium, iodine, gadolinium

# X-ray (plain radiograph)
- useful for skeletal system, and some diseases in soft tissue
- heterogeneous beam of X-rays shot from anterior to posterior (unless chest)
- lateral views more commonly used for appendicular skeleton
- absorbed by dense tissue (appears white)
	- otherwise appears dark

## advantages
- cheap
- readily available
## disadvantages
- uses ionising radiation
- limited range of densities
- 2D representation of 3D object
## limitations of x-rays
- only calcified tissue shows up clearly
- not very sensitive
	- 30% of bone mass must be lost before the issue can be seen on an X-ray
- things in front can obscure things behind
- processes taking place inside of bone cannot be seen

## AP vs PA chest X-rays

|           | PA view                                                   | AP view                                                     |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clavicles | Seen over lung fields                                     | Seen above apex of lung field                               |
| Scapula   | Inner borders seen away from lung fields                  | Inner borders seen over lung fields                         |
| Ribs      | Posterior of ribs more distinct. Ribs appear more slanted | Anterior of ribs more distinct. Ribs appear more horizontal |
| Heart     | Gives more realistic size of heart                        | Heart shadow appears bigger (apparent cardiomegaly)         |
| When used | Usual view for chest more most people                     | Used for bedridden and infants                              |
- AP of chest makes the heart look bigger, so use PA so you can see problems with the heart

# DEXA scan (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry)
- two different low energy X-ray beams
	- the beams are stopped by different densities
		- measure how much of each is absorbed to get a better idea of the density
- used for diagnosis of osteoporosis and for body mass calculations

# CT scans (computerised tomography)
- multiple X-ray beams
- builds up a cross section of the body's organs and tissues

## advantages
- cross-sectional images allow for reconstruction of a 3D image
- good high-contrast bone detail
- well tolerated
- readily available
## disadvantages
- ionising radiation dose
- metallic artefacts cause loss of detail
- soft tissue surrounded by bone difficult to image
- respiratory movement artefact

## example

# MRI scan (magnetic resonance imaging)
- uses non-ionising radiation
- very high soft tissue contrast
- can get both structural and functional information

## T1 - normal anatomy
- in the brain it gives good grey/white matter contrast (fat - white = myelin, yellow bone marrow etc)
## T2 - pathology
- sensitive to water content of tissue
- inflammation or [[Medical School/Year 1/cr/week 2/microcirculation and oedema#Oedema\|oedema]] in damaged tissue means higher water content

# Ultrasound
- uses sound waves (no radiation)
- cheap and readily available
- difficult to interpret
- portable and real-time, so can look at movement
## Dopper Ultrasound
- uses ultrasound to look at blood flow in arteries and veins

# Contrast Media
- solutions or suspensions of non-toxic substances that contain elements of high atomic number

## Barium
- barium sulfate meal/enema

## Iodine
- angiography in x-rays and CT scans
![anatomy imaging-20241030130013674.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/anatomy%20imaging-20241030130013674.png)

## Gadolinium
- rare earth metal which shortens relaxation time of protons
- does not readily cross the blood brain barrier, so useful for tumours when BBB compromised
