# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Locate and name the major body cavities and their subdivisions
- [ ] List the major organs contained within the major cavities
- [ ] Identify the serous membranes and indicate their common function
- [ ] Identify the main components of the cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, urinary, endocrine and reproductive systems of the body
- [ ] Locate the major organs in cross section and on MRI and CT

# Body Cavities
![introduction to body cavities-20241101120917108.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/introduction%20to%20body%20cavities-20241101120917108.png)

## Cranial Cavity
- space within the skull which houses the brain
- surrounded by three layers (the [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 6/introduction to the central nervous system#Meninges\|meninges]])

## Serous Membranes (abdominal/thoracic cavities)
- three membranes
	- pleural cavity
	- pericardium
	- peritoneum
- one continuous structure with two parts which are functionally different
	- visceral and parietal layers
		- visceral covers the organ, parietal is around it
			- ![introduction to body cavities-20241101122135843.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/introduction%20to%20body%20cavities-20241101122135843.png)
		- serous fluid in the cavity between these two layers reduces friction between the opposing surfaces
		- parietal layers share nerve supply to body wall: **somatic**
		- visceral layers share nerve supply to the organ: **autonomic**

## Thoracic Cavity
- one pleural cavity around each lung
- mediastinum is between the pleural cavities
	- contains the pericardium
		- contains the heart

### Pleura
![introduction to body cavities-20241101122513001.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/introduction%20to%20body%20cavities-20241101122513001.png)
- continuous double-layered membrane
- surface on the lung surface is visceral pleura, surface in contact with cavity wall is parietal pleura
- important for surface tension
	- air within the pleural cavity leads to pneumothorax

### Mediastinum
- contains heart, great vessels, aorta, trachea, oesophagus, vagus nerve, phrenic nerve, thoracic duct
#### Pericardium
- visceral pericardium surrounding heart
- fibrous pericardium covers the heart
	- limits heart from overfilling as it does not stretch very much

# Abdomen
## Abdominal Divisions
![introduction to body cavities-20241101123504652.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/introduction%20to%20body%20cavities-20241101123504652.png)

## Abdominal Cavity
- stomach
	- ![introduction to body cavities-20241101123938671.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/introduction%20to%20body%20cavities-20241101123938671.png)
- duodenum
	- ![introduction to body cavities-20241101124100847.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/introduction%20to%20body%20cavities-20241101124100847.png)
- pancreas
	- ![introduction to body cavities-20241101124126176.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/introduction%20to%20body%20cavities-20241101124126176.png)
- liver
	- largest gland in the body
	- under the right dome of the diaphragm
	- covered by the ribcage so usually cannot be palpated
	- connected to gall bladder
		- liver produces bile which is sent to the gall bladder
- jejunum and ileum
	- ![introduction to body cavities-20241101124237130.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/introduction%20to%20body%20cavities-20241101124237130.png)
- colon
	- ![introduction to body cavities-20241101124315388.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/introduction%20to%20body%20cavities-20241101124315388.png)
	- start from cecum
- spleen
	- ![introduction to body cavities-20241101124520187.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/introduction%20to%20body%20cavities-20241101124520187.png)
	- size of a fist, high up on the left side of the abdomen, underneath the diaphragm
- kidneys and adrenal glands
	- kidneys sit on posterior abdominal wall
		- left kidney is higher
	- adrenal glands sit on the superior pole of the kidneys

## Peritoneum
- one layer covers the entire abdomen and folds at certain points
- some organs are surrounded by peritoneum, others are within

## Pelvic Cavity
### in males
- bladder, prostate, vas deferens, rectum
![introduction to body cavities-20241101125638634.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/introduction%20to%20body%20cavities-20241101125638634.png)
