# Learning Objectives
- [ ] To describe how the CNS is protected
- Skull
- Meninges
- CSF
- [ ] To describe the components of the CNS
- Structures
- Cells (neurons and glia)
- [ ] To briefly describe the function of the CNS

# Brain/Spinal Cord Protection
## Blood-brain barrier
- formed by [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 6/histology of nerve and muscle tissue#astrocytes\|astrocytes]]

## Blood Supply of the Brain and the Circle of Willis
![introduction to the central nervous system-20241029112139233.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/introduction%20to%20the%20central%20nervous%20system-20241029112139233.png)

## Cerebrospinal Fluid
- produced mainly by the [[Medical School/Year 1/bb/week 3/meninges, csf, and the blood brain barrier#Choroid Plexus\|choroid plexus]] in the lateral, third and fourth ventricles
- flows from the lateral ventricle to the third ventricle through the interventricular foramen
- third and fourth ventricles connected by cerebral aqueduct
- CSF then flows into the subarachnoid space through the 2 lateral apertures (of Luschka) and the single median aperture (foramen of Magendie)
- absorption of the CSF back into the blood stream takes place in the superior sagittal sinus through structures called arachnoid villi
## Skull & Vertebral Column
## Meninges
![introduction to the central nervous system-20241029110946820.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/introduction%20to%20the%20central%20nervous%20system-20241029110946820.png)
### Dura mater
- attached to the inside of the skull
- folds back on itself (double layered)
	- periosteal layer attached to the bones of the skull
	- meningeal layer fused with the periosteal layer (except at dural sinuses)
	- falx cerebri, tentorium cerebelli and falx cerebelli are double layers of meningeal layer
	- forms venous sinuses e.g. superior sagittal sinus
- thick, fibrous
#### Nerve Supply
- CN V and X
	- referred pain to the head from above the tentorium cerebelli
- spinal nerves C1-3
- sympathetic
#### Blood Supply
- internal carotid, external carotid, and vertebral arteries
	- middle meningeal artery biggest branch of exernal carotid
		- think of a pterion injury
### Arachnoid mater
![introduction to the central nervous system-1742296849745.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/introduction%20to%20the%20central%20nervous%20system-1742296849745.webp)
- avascular and not attached to meningeal dura
- thinner, more delicate
- outer compact layer (barrier cells) and inner trabecular meshwork containing CSF
- subarachnoid space filled with CSF, which buffers and protects the brain and spinal cord
### Pia mater
- thin membrane loosely connected to arachnoid
- attached to the basement lamina of the brain
- only absent at natural openings between ventricles
	- median and lateral apertures

# What is in the CNS?
![introduction to the central nervous system-20241029112749121.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/introduction%20to%20the%20central%20nervous%20system-20241029112749121.png)

## Neurones
### Sensory Neurones
- impulses from PNS to CNS
### Relay Neurones
- interneurone (majority of neurones)
### Motor Neurones
- impulses from CNS to PNS to muscle

## Glial Cells
### Astrocytes
- trophic influence on neurones
- control neurotransmitters
- perivascular feet are part of the blood-brain and blood-spinal cord barriers

### Oligodendrocytes
- myelination of CNS
- insulating coat which greatly increases the speed of nerve conduction

### Microglia
- "CNS macrophages"
- mediators of neuroinflammation

Stage I (quiescent): highly ramified

# Neurotransmitters and the CNS
![introduction to the central nervous system-20241029114116784.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/introduction%20to%20the%20central%20nervous%20system-20241029114116784.png)

# Structures of the CNS
## Roles of the Lobes
![introduction to the central nervous system-20241029114334942.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/introduction%20to%20the%20central%20nervous%20system-20241029114334942.png)

## [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 6/introduction to the nervous system#telencephalon (cerebrum)\|forebrain]] and cerebral cortex
- grey matter outer layer
	- neuronal cell bodies (unmyelinated)
	- 1.5-5cm thick
- white matter underneath
	- myelinated axons
	- pathways for information to and from the cortex
- subcortical, deep nuclei
	- collection of neuronal cell bodies
	- relay stations for information going to or from the cortex (e.g. basal ganglia)

## The Brainstem
- provides main sensory and motor innervation to the face and neck (cranial nerves III to XII)
- conductive functions
	- ascending and descending tracts carry information to and from the cortex to the periphery
- integrative functions (reticular formation)

# Cranial Nerves: ANS
- CN III
	- pupil size and lens focussing
- CN VII
	- saliva production
	- tear production
- CN IX
	- saliva production
- CN X
	- just about everything else

# The Spinal Cord
- grey matter inside, white matter outside
- protected by vertebral column
