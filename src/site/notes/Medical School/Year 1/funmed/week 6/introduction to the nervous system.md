# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Compare and contrast the involvement of the CNS vs PNS in the production of behaviour
- [ ] Gross anatomy and functions of the nervous system.
- [ ] List the main constituents of the CNS and PNS
- [ ] Understand the role of neurones compared to that of oligodendrocytes
- [ ] Compare and contrast the main functions of the major divisions of the brain

# CNS and PNS
CNS myelinated by oligodendrocytes
- brain, spinal cord, cranial nerves I and II

# Grey and White Matter
- in spinal cord
	- grey matter located centrally surrounded by white matter
- in brain
	- grey matter outermost, white matter deeper

## Grey Matter
- 40%
- controls most of the brain's neuronal cell bodies
- processes and sends information to various parts of the body
## White Matter
- 60%
- made up of bundles of axons which connect various grey areas
- interprets sensory information
- decision-making, selection, initiation, and control of motor responses

# The Cells of the CNS
## Neurones

## Oligodendrocyte
- for myelination of neurones in the CNS only
![introduction to the nervous system-20241028093759034.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/introduction%20to%20the%20nervous%20system-20241028093759034.png)
## Schwann Cells
- for myelination of neurones in the PNS only
![introduction to the nervous system-20241028093822438.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/introduction%20to%20the%20nervous%20system-20241028093822438.png)

# The Major Divisions of the Brain
![introduction to the nervous system-20241028094107650.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/introduction%20to%20the%20nervous%20system-20241028094107650.png)
## Forebrain
- the most dorsal division of the brain
### telencephalon (cerebrum)
 - cerebral cortex (grey matter)
- subcortical white matter
	- commissural fibres
	- association fibres
	- projection fibres
- subcortical structures
	- dorsal and ventral striatum (basal ganglia)
	- limbic system

-  everything rostral to the central sulcus is for movement-related activities
- everything caudal to the central sulcus is for perceiving and learning

#### thalamus
- relays sensory information to the cerebral cortex
- receives information from the cerebral cortex and relays it to another region
- controls the general excitability of the cerebral cortex
#### hypothalamus
- controls the autonomic nervous system
- controls the endocrine system
- organises behaviours related to the survival of the species (instincts)
## Midbrain
### tectum
- superior (visual system) and inferior colliculi (auditory system)
### tegmentum
- rostral reticular formation
	- involved in sleep, arousal, attention, movement, muscle tone, reflexes
- periaqueductal grey
	- neural circuits involved in species-typical behaviours (fighting, mating)
- red nucleus
	- motor relay
- substantia nigra
	- modulation of motor output
## Hindbrain
### metencephalon
- pons
	- contains a portion of the reticular formation
- cerebellum
	- contains a cerebellar cortex and deep cerebellar nuclei
### myelencephalon
- medulla oblongata
	- most caudal part of the brainstem
	- contains parts of the reticular formation
	- regulation of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems and skeletal muscle tone
