# Learning Obejctives
- [ ] Distinguish between **monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides**
- [ ] Define **glycosidic bonds, sugar esterification, amino sugar, deoxy sugar**
- [ ] Define the mecahnism and biological importance of **protein glycosylation**
- [ ] Outline the structures and biological roles of **glycogen, heparin, proteoglycan, bacterial lipopolysaccharide**

# Monosaccharides
- Contain 3-7 carbons
	- more than 4 carbons are found as rings
- Aldehydes --> Aldoses
- Ketones --> Ketoses

## Structure
Monosaccharides containing one/more chiral carbons have a **D-form** and an **L-form**
- **D-form:** -OH group attached to the right of the chiral carbon
- **L-form:** -OH group attached to the left of the chiral carbon
If there is more than one chiral carbon:
- Look at the chiral carbon **furthest away from the carbonyl group** to determine its naming
- D-form is most common

Cyclic rings formed from monosaccharides with 5-6 carbons - the OH on C5 reacts with the carbonyl group
In solution, equilibrium between straight chain and two cyclic forms
	- cyclic form is more stable because it is "locked"

# Modified sugars
- often used in site recognition on cell surfaces
- usually the OH group is replaced with NH2/SO4/PO4
- removal of OH = deoxy sugar

## Sulfated sugars
- produced by the action of sulpho-transferase
- form **glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)** [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 1/extracellular matrix and cell adhesion#Proteoglycan Aggregates\|found in extracellular matrix]]
- makes the **GAG** highly negatively charged, therefore hydrophilic

# Disaccharides
- maltose = α glucose + α glucose
- lactose = β glucose + β galactose
- sucrose = α glucose + β fructose
Glycol transferases catalyse the formation of glyocsidic bonds

# Glycogen
- Insulin acts on **hepatocytes** to stimulate **glycogen synthase**
	- **Glycogenin** acts as a primer to allow the polymerisation of the first few glucose molecules (this is a glycosyltransferase)
- Glycogen phosphorylase breaks down glycogen

# Heparin and Heparan Sulfate
- **Glycosaminoglycan** important in blood clotting pathway
	- thrombin important in converting fibrinogen to fibrin
		- heparin inhibits thrombin via an allosteric effect
			- therefore heparin can be used as an anticoagulent

# Lipo-polysaccharides
- "innate" immune system due to microbial pattern recognition receptors called [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 9/how does the immune system recognise pathogens#by innate immune cells\|**Toll-like receptors (TLRs)**]]
