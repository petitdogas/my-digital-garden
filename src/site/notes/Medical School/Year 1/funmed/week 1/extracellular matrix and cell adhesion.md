# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Look at key components that make up most of the ECM including **collagen** and **proteoglycans**
- [ ] Describe how loss of cell adhesion can lead to diseases
- [ ] Understand how ECM allows adhesion and movement

# Functions of the ECM
- adhesive substrate
- provides structure
- presents growth factors to receptors
- sequesters and stores growth factors
- senses and transduces mechanical signals

Therefore, the ECM regulates proliferation, differentiation, migration, and cell-cell interactions

# Macromolecules Network
- Made by cells (fibroblasts, chondroblasts, osteoblasts)
	- collagens
	- elastin
	- glycoproteins
	- proteoglycans
- Macromolecules form a 3D gelatinous bed for cells to live in

## Collagen
- 25% of total protein mass in the body
- 34 related peptide chains
- Classic structure is triple helix formed by 3 peptide chains
	- every third amino acid is glycine
		- Glys-X-Y (proline or hydroxyproline)
### Types of Collagen
- 28 different types
	- 2 families
		- Fibrillar (type I, II, III, V, Xi)
		- Nonfibrillar

**Type I** - 90% of total body collagen; densely-packed fibres which provides structure
	- bone, dermis, fibrocartilage, blood vessels, tendon
**Type II** - loosely packed fibres
	- elastic and hyaline cartilage
**Type III** - supports glands and organs
	- skin, blood vessels, and internal organs (liver)
**Type IV** - netforming
	- basement membrane helps to connect epithelia to connective tissue
**Type V** - essential for fibrilation of Types 1 and III collagen
	- blood vessels, cell surfaces, hair, and placenta
	- 50% of patients with Ehlers Danlos syndrome have heterozygous mutation in Type V

### Osteogenesis imperfecta
"brittle bone disease"
- defect in collagen type I synthesis
	- fragile bones, thin skin, abnormal teeth, weak tendons, thin sclera (looks blue)
- cause by a non-conservative missense mutation so that glycine replaced with a bulkier amino acid
	- therefore helices are looser (bends and kinks in collagen)
![extracellular matrix and cell adhesion-20240927122338746.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%201/attachments/extracellular%20matrix%20and%20cell%20adhesion-20240927122338746.png)
any tissue which is comprised of collagen Type I is much weaker

- Type I is autosomal dominant
	- Chromosome 17, COL1A1 gene
	- Chromosome 7, COL1A2 gene
	- mildest - blue sclera and more likely to break bones
- Type II is most severe
	- new mutation
	- foetus dies (would be dominant if individuals survived)

## Elastin
- Allows for stretching in two dimensions
- Rich in glycine and proline
- More **valine** than found in collagen (interacts with hydrophobic domains, providing elasticity)
- Crosslinks between lysines
	- This flexibility is required for blood vessels, lungs, ligaments, and skin (dermis)
		- it's so stretchy that we have to coat it in something that makes it less floppy
			- surrounded by fibrillin to restrain elasticity

### Roles of fibrillin
- anchors elastic fibres to other ECM proteins - structural role
- modulates binding of growth factors **(TGF-β)** and sequesters them
### Marfan Syndrome
- misfolding in fibrilin changes the properties of ECM
- tall stature, long arms and legs, arachnodactyly, loose joints, floppy cardiac valves, lens dislocation, aortic aneurysms
In Marfans patients, TGF-β is not bound to ECM
- accumulates in lungs, heart, other tissues
	- stimulates production of more elastin

## Glycoproteins
- Act as receptors on cell surface
- Strength and support to the ECM
- Slime layer of bacteria and flagella

### Fibronectin and Laminin
Fibronectin
- cell adhesion
- cell migration
- cell shape
- cell differentiation
- cytoskeleton organisation
Laminin
- cell adhesion (basement membrane)
- cell migration
- cytoskeleton organisation
Laminin attaches to integrin to indirectly attach to the cell

## Proteoglycans
- Gel-forming components of the ECM
- Peptide chains with covalently bound sugars
	- proteins conjugated to polysaccharides with serial repeat units
- 95% carbohydrate, 5% protein
	- Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), mucopolysaccharides

### Proteoglycan Aggregates
Proteoglycans can form large aggregates, which draw and hold water in the tissue (due to GAG), forming a jelly-like matrix
- gives compressive strength to tissues
	- you can squeeze the water out like a sponge, but then the water comes back in once the proteoglycans relax

### Ageing
- shorter core, fewer side chains
- less water attracted into tissue (dries out)
- more likely to be damaged

### Healing
- upregulation of proteoglycans in damaged area
	- causes initial swelling as water moves in
		- brings in more nutrients and growth factors

# Cell Adhesion
- Cell adhesion to ECM via **cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)**
- Homophilic (homotypic) adhesions connect between the same molecules
- Heterphilic (heterptypic) adhesion between different types of molecules (selectins and mucins)
Involved in:
- Signal transduction, migration, organisation
- Most CAMs belong to 5 major protein families:
	- Cadherins
	- Ig Super family
	- Mucins
	- Integrins
	- Selectins
		- Type of lectin
			- Bind to sugar polymers
			- WBC homing

# Cell Migration
