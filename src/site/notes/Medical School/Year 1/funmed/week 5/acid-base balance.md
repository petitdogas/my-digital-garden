## Excretion of H+
### Respiratory regulation of acid-base homeostasis
- peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch
	- signal to the brain stem via cranial nerves to alter the respiratory rate
- central chemoreceptors in the brain detect pH of cerebrospinal fluid

- hypoventilation accumulates CO2 in blood, increasing carbonic acid levels, thus decreasing blood pH
	- respiratory acidosis
- hyperventilation expels more CO2 in blood, decreasing carbonic acid levels, thus increasing blood pH
	- respiratory alkalosis

### Kidney regulation of acid-base balance
#### Reabsorption of HCO3-
- most of the filtered HCO3− is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule
- virtually no HCO3− remains in the final urine
![acid-base balance-20241025123435268.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%205/attachments/acid-base%20balance-20241025123435268.png)

![acid-base balance-20241025123510373.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%205/attachments/acid-base%20balance-20241025123510373.png)
- H+ ions are secreted into the lumen via the sodium-hydrogen (Na+-H+) exchanger to combine with any filtered bicarbonate.
	- forms carbonic acid, catalysed by carbonic anhydrase on the luminal side.
		- carbonic acid then dissociates into CO2 and H2O, which both diffuse into the cell.
			- carbonic anhydrase inside the cell converts CO2 and H2O to H2CO3, which then dissociates into H+ and HCO3– ions.
				- HCO3– can then be transported into the blood whilst the H+ ions can be transported back into the lumen for the cycle to repeat

### Excretion of H+ and production of bicarbonate in kidneys
![acid-base balance-20241025123731824.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%205/attachments/acid-base%20balance-20241025123731824.png)
- glutamine is converted to glutamate and ammonium in the proximal convoluted tubule
	- ammonium dissociates to ammonia and H+ ions, allowing it to pass the through membrane and enter the lumen
		- in the lumen, reforms ammonium by picking up a luminal H+ ion
			- this allows H+ to be excreted as ammonium ions, increasing blood pH

- NH4+ secreted at the PCT can be used further down to buffer and excrete H+ ions secreted by alpha-intercalated cells in the collecting duct
	- this is due to its ability to pass membranes and traverse the nephron.
- glutamate created from glutamine can also go on to form bicarbonate, which can then be reabsorbed

### Active Excretion of H+ by kidneys
![acid-base balance-20241025124829679.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%205/attachments/acid-base%20balance-20241025124829679.png)
- Dihydrogen phosphate - H+ ions are actively transported into the lumen via hydrogen-ATPase pumps on alpha-intercalated cells
- Excess luminal phosphate (only 85% of total phosphate is normally reabsorbed) can bind a large portion of hydrogen ions, buffering them as H2PO4– before excretion.
- This excretion of H+ ions increases blood pH

# Anion Gap
- measures the balance between measured and unmeasured ions, helps to identify the cause of metabolic acidosis by pointing out if there are unmeasured acids affecting the balance

Note whether the pH is low (acidosis) or high (alkalosis)
What is the PaCO2 value?
- Respiratory indicator
What is the HCO3- value?
