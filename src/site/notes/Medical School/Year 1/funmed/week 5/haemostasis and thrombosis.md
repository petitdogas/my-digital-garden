# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Describe the role of platelets in haemostasis
- [ ] Describe the role of the clotting cascade in haemostasis
- [ ] Describe thrombosis & Virchow's Triad

# Blood Clotting: Platelets
![haemostasis and thrombosis-20241023120803813.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%205/attachments/haemostasis%20and%20thrombosis-20241023120803813.png)
- Clotting factors released by damaged cells
- Clotting factors cause platelets to become sticky & adhere to damaged region to form a solid 'plugâ€™

# Primary Haemostasis
- damage to endothelial layer exposes the von Willebrand factor
	- glycoprotein 1b receptor binds to von Willebrand factor
		- conformational change, activation of platelets
			- other receptors (glycoprotein Iib/IIa) bind to other platelets, causing platelet aggregation
				- fibrin tangles the platelet clump and stabilises the clot

# Clotting Cascade (Secondary Haemostasis)
![haemostasis and thrombosis-20241023121300603.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%205/attachments/haemostasis%20and%20thrombosis-20241023121300603.png)
**polymerisation of fibrin & activation of platelets = blood clot**
- both pathways activate Factor X (beginning of the common pathway)
## Factors
Factor II: Prothrombin
Factor Ila: Thrombin
Factor I: Fibrinogen
Factor la: Fibrin
Thromboplastin: Tissue factor: Factor III

# Anti-coagulents

Warfarin inhibits Factors 2,7,9,10
[[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 1/sugars and polysaccharides#Heparin and Heparan Sulfate\|Heparin]] activates Anti-Thrombin III (lyses Thrombin & factor Xa, & is not vitamin K-dependent )
Tissue factor pathway inhibitor- Inhibits Xa (eg Rivaroxaban)

# Thrombosis
- pathological clot (thrombus) formation within a blood vessel
- embolism
	- part of clot breaks off and travels through circulation until obstructed by vessels of smaller diameter

## Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)
- distal - confined to calf veins
- proximal - involve popliteal vein or above

in normal legs
- normally, contracting muscle squeezes vein, opens proximal valve, and pushes blood up towards heart
- pressure on distal valve closes the valve

if muscles do not contract, valves become stagnant
- clots form above and below valves
![haemostasis and thrombosis-20241023123115759.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%205/attachments/haemostasis%20and%20thrombosis-20241023123115759.png)
muscle contraction after this will increase pressure
- dislodging the clot
	- clot forms an embolus
		- travels proximally to the heart
			- through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs


## Pulmonary Embolism (PE)
- dislodged thrombus (embolus) migrating into pulmonary arteries

# Virchow's Triad
- endothelial injury
- stasis or turbulence of blood flow
- blood hypercoagulability
the presence of one of these increases venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk - presence of multiple is high risk

## Reduced or stagnant blood flow
- flowing blood stimulates endothelium to release nitric oxide and prostacyclin
	- these prevent platelet adhesion to endothelial wall
	- when blood stops flowing, spontaneous clotting occurs
### risk factors
- long-haul flights (prolonged sitting)
- immobilisation in bed
- obesity
- sickle cell disease

## Vessel Wall Pathology
### risk factors
- chronic inflammatory disease damage the endothelial wall, and reduce the amounts of attached [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 1/sugars and polysaccharides#Heparin and Heparan Sulfate\|heparin]] and downregulate thrombomodulin
	- rheumatoid arthiritis, irritable bowel disease

## Hypercoagulability
- increase tendency to develop blood clots
- consider hypercoagulation workup if no obvious cause for VTE and family history of DVT/PE

### risk factors

| Congenital               | Acquired   |
| ------------------------ | ---------- |
| Protein C deficiency     | Pregnancy  |
| Antithrombin deficiency  | Smoking    |
| Factor V Leiden Mutation | Trauma     |
|                          | Malignancy |
