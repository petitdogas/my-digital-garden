# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Explain the concept of homeostasis, with reference to set point, control centre, receptors, effectors
- [ ] Describe the term “negative feedback loop"
- [ ] Be able to describe examples of homeostasis in the human body, such as thermoregulation, blood glucose regulation, including how receptors and effectors maintain homeostasis in those systems
- [ ] Explain the term positive feedback, using the release of oxytocin during pregnancy as an example

Receptor (sensor): responds specifically to the physiological variable (not other variables)
Effector: a system that can act to restore the variable to its desired level

# Thermoregulation
- important for enzymatic action and protein integrity

## Thermoreceptors in Skin
- bare nerve endings
- two types of thermoreceptors in skin: cold and warm

Skin cooling – effect on nerve firing of warm receptive thermoregulators vs cold receptive thermoregulators

> [!NOTE]+ Example: Skin Cooling
> Transient increase in the firing of cold receptors and transient decrease in the activation of warm receptors

The control centre is the hypothalamus

## Mechanisms of Heat Transfer
- conduction - ineffective when outside is hotter
- convection - ineffective when outside is hotter
- evaporation - ineffective when humidity above 75%
- radiation - ineffective when outside is hotter

## Insensible Heat Loss
- 570kcal of heat lost for each litre of water evaporating from the body
- Water evaporates continuously from lungs, mucosa of mouth and skin – therefore there is basal (resting) level of “insensible heat loss” through evaporation
	- ~600ml a day

## Effectors
### Sweat Glands and Hair Follicles
- primarily ecrine sweat glands (apocrine is more for stress-related sweating)
- hair muscles relax, hairs lie flat so heat can escape
- sweat secreted by sweat glands cool skin

### Cutaneous Vasodilation
- mediated by autonomic nervous system
- reduction in vasomotor tone
- vasculature swells with warm blood
	- heat lost more readily from body surface by [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 5/homeostasis#Mechanisms of Heat Transfer\|mechanisms of heat loss]]

### Non-shivering Thermogenesis
- metabolic heat generation through processes other than muscle contraction
	- calorigenic hormones and stimulation of brown fat
	- catecholamines, adrenaline, noradrenaline
	- thyroid hormones increase oxygen consumption of most cells and increase basal metabolic rate and heat production during prolonged cold exposure

### Piloerection
- hair muscles pull hairs on end
- erect hairs trap air

### Cutaneous Vasoconstriction
- increase in sympathetic activity
- mediated by action of noradrenaline on α-adrenoreceptors in blood vessels
- arteriovenous anastomoses
	- decrease blood flow to capillaries

# Glucose Regulation

alpha and beta cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans themselves sense glucose through specialised membrane receptors – this is called “stimulus-secretion coupling”

## Glucagon
- released by pancreatic alpha cells in the islets of Langerhans
- stimulates liver glucose production from glycogen
	- glycogenolysis
		- liver glycogen --> glucose
	- gluconeogenesis
		- amino acids and glyceral --> glucose
- inhibited by high glucose levels

## Insulin
- released by pancreatic beta cells in the islets of Langerhans
- glycogenesis
	- glucose --> glycogen
- 2/3 of body cells take up glucose via GLUT4
- inhibited by hypoglycaemia

# Positive Feedback: Oxytocin
- uterine contractions cause oxytocin to increase
	- oxytocin acts on uterus, causing contractions to increase
		- stops shortly after birth
