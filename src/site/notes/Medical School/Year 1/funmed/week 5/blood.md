# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Describe the major constituents of blood
- [ ] Explain the roles of different blood cells
- [ ] Describe different blood tests

# What is blood?
- constantly circulating fluid
- average person has 5 litres of blood
- 55% plasma, 45% cellular components
	- 4% WBC 41% RBC

# Blood Cell Development
- Haemopoiesis = production of blood cells
	- occurs in the bone marrow

- monocytes differentiate into macrophages

# Types of Blood Cells
## Erythrocytes
- anucleate
- function only within the blood stream
- biconcave shape with diameter of 7.8Âµ
	- maintained by internal and peripheral membrane proteins

### Disorders of Erythrocytes
### Anaemia
- lack of haem
- many different causes e.g. RBC loss, bleeding, destruction
- can be classified by:
	- RBC size
		- normocytic
		- macrocytic
		- microcytic
	- haemoglobin content
		- normochromic
		- hypochromic
		- hyperchromic

## Leukocytes
## Granulocytes
- containing cytoplasmic granules
- neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils
### Neutrophil
- most abundant granulocyte
- multilobed nucleus - polymorphonuclear/polymorphs
- specific granules (secondary) - small and not visible under light microscopy
	- contain enzymes, complement acitvators, and antimicrobial peptides
- azurophilic granules (primary) - large and numerous
	- myeloperoxidase (MPO) helps to generate bactericidal compounds

#### Function of Neutrophils

### Eosinophils & Basophils
#### Eosinophils
-  same size are neutrophils
- eosinophilic granules in their cytoplasm
- specific granules: eosinophil peroxidase and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin - cytotoxic action
- azurophilic granules - lysosomal acid hydrolases
- associated with allergic reaction, parasitic infections and chronic inflammation
#### Basophils
- least numerous of WBCs
- large, basophilic granules
- specific granules: heparin, histamine, leukotrienes, IL-4, IL-3 etc.
- azurophilic - lysosomal enzymes
- function similar to mast cells
## Agranulocytes
### Lymphocytes 
- about same size as RBCs
- three functional distinct types: B cells, T cells and NK cells
- intensely stained cytoplasm with very thin nucleus, no recognisable cytoplasmic organelles
- function in adaptive immunity
### Monocytes
- precursors of the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system
- migrate from the bone marrow to the tissues 
	- where they differentiate into tissue specific phagocytes such as alveolar macrophages, Kupffer cells etc.

## Platelets
- small cytoplasmic discoid fragments derived from the megakaryocyte under the control of thrombopoietin
- megakaryocytes develop cytoplasmic projections that become proplatelets, which fragment into platelets in about 7-10 days

# Blood Tests
## Blood glucose tests
- fasting glucose test - checked after fasting for 8 hours
- glucose tolerance test - testing after fasting, and 2 hours after being given a glucose drink
- glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) - measure of average blood sugar level over the past 3 months

## Arterial Blood Gas (ABG)
- assesses blood pH, oxygen, CO2
- complications of arterial puncture
	- pain, failure of procedure, arterial damage, haemorrhage/local haematoma

## Venous Blood Gas (VBG)
- technically easier procedure than ABG with less pain

## Full Blood Count (FBC)
- types and numbers of cells in your blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets

## Peripheral Blood Smear / Blood Film
- for evaluation of WBCs, RBCs, and platelets
- can see the size, shape, and colour of the cells, and number of platelets

## Blood Culture
- suspect infection
- tests for the presence of pathogens e.g. bacteria
- the samples are analysed in the laboratory by incubation for detection of specific microorganisms
