- [ ] Describe how energy generated in the cells
- [ ] Define the principal energy stores in human body
- [ ] Explain the roles of ATP in reaction to biochemical reactions, cellular transport and motility

# Glucose

## GLUT

| GLUT 1 | Blood<br>Blood-Brain Barrier<br>Heart (lesser extent)     | Insulin-Dependent                              |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |

# ATP

Gibbs free energy decreases by 30.5 kJ/mol per phosphate group lost
(i.e. making AMP would be -61 kJ/mol)

# Energy Storage in the Body
## Phosphocreatine
- 43.3 kJ (10.3 kcal) per mole
- ~120g stored
- Max effort 5-8 sec

## Glycogen
- 1g = 4kcal
- Liver ~100 g
- Muscles ~350 g

# Thermogenesis (non-shivering)
- in [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 3/connective tissue histology#brown adipose tissue\|brown fat]], activation of UCP1 induces a leak of protons through the membrane and “uncouples” the free energy stored in the electrochemical gradient from ATP synthesis

# ATP in cell signalling - purinergic pathways
- NT release
- smooth muscle contraction
- platelet aggregation
- immune cell activation
