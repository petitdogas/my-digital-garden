- Please see below the learning objectives for the clinical skills required in **year 1**, which you are also required to demonstrate as part of your **eLogbook**.  You will see that for some the whole examination is not included.  This is because you will learn the full examination in year 2, however to help you build on your learning you should be able to demonstrate the skills below. 
- Please review the video links provided, which detail where you watch the specific parts of the examination you should be able to do in year 1 (the time in the video is provided in brackets).  You can, of course, watch the full video as this will help you to prepare for year 2.  
- Please remember to review this examination in the Clinical Skills Handbook at the end of the skills section on QM Plus, which covers the ‘minimum’ content you should know by the end of year 2.  The year 2 sections are in bold, which is optional area for you to review.  It is important to ensure you understand the basic sciences such as physiology and anatomy that supplement your clinical skills learning, so that you can understand what you are doing at each stage of the examination and why, as well as develop skills like clinical and diagnostic reasoning.  
- This is not meant to replace face to face teaching, however it is important to remember that clinical skills like all skills require regular practice.  You should try to seek opportunities to practice when possible and during face to face teaching, ask your supervisors or the academic team to check your technique.  This is to ensure that you are competent at performing the skills in preparation for examining patients.
