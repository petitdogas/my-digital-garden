# Gut Brain Axis
- roles in
	- motility
	- nutrient uptake
	- hormone and enzyme release
	- appetite regulation
	- vascular flow
	- immune cell activity
![gut health and disease-1740926187817.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%202/attachments/gut%20health%20and%20disease-1740926187817.webp)
## Intrinsic Innervation - communication within the gut
- ganglionated plexi - myenteric ganglia and submucosal ganglia
	- myenteric - information about mechanical movement
	- submucosal - information from lumen (look for nutrients)
## Neural Networks of ENS
![gut health and disease-1740926398772.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%202/attachments/gut%20health%20and%20disease-1740926398772.webp)
- connectivity between different neurones via interneurones
- critical for GIT function
## Extrinsic Innervation
- vagus nerve!!
	- central terminals enter brainstem and synapse to neurones of the nucleus tractus solitarus.

# Gut Microbiota
## Faecal Microbiota Transfer (FMT)
- to increase microbiota diversity
- only approved for treatment of C. diff following failure of antibiotic therapy
## C. diff (Clostridium difficile)
- associated with broad spectrum antibiotic usage
	- opportunistic overgrowth
- causes watery diarrhoea and abdominal pain
- treatment
	- stop antibiotic use
	- vanomycin or metronidazole
	- [[Medical School/Year 1/met/week 2/gut health and disease#Faecal Microbiota Transfer (FMT)\|FMT]]
## Prebiotics and Probiotics for gut health
- prebiotics
	- promote growth of good gut microbiota
		- bifidobacterium and lactobacillus
	- contain non-digestible food ingredients
- probiotics
	- live cultures found in dairy products / fermented products

# Common GI Conditions
## GORD

# Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GORD)
![gastric secretions-1739878862521.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%202/attachments/gastric%20secretions-1739878862521.webp)
![gastric secretions-1739878716649.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%202/attachments/gastric%20secretions-1739878716649.webp)
- lower oesophageal sphincter relaxes too much, causing reflux
- risk factors
	- excessive reflux of normal gastric juice
		- increased frequency of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations
	- weakened lower oesophageal sphincter
	- histal hernia
	- obesity
	- family history of GORD
## Symptoms
- heartburn - burning midsternal sensation
- acid reflux - sour or bitter taste, mainly after meals
- extra-oesophageal symptoms
	- cough
	- laryngitis
	- asthma
	- dental erosion
- may be asymptomatic
## Treatment
- Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)
	- do not fix the underlying pathophysiology
		- just makes the acid less acidic, so less damage
- avoid NSAIDs/aspirin (since they make the acid more acidic)
	- ![gastric secretions-1739879082099.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%202/attachments/gastric%20secretions-1739879082099.webp)
## Complication - Barret's Oesophagus
- normal epithelium of the oesaphagus is squamous
	- after constantly being exposed to acid, they change shape - metaplasia
		- they become columnar epithelium and goblet cells
		- increases risk of dysplasia, so increased risk of malignancy
			- development of oesophageal adenocarcinoma
- patients presenting with **dysphagia** should be investigated


</div></div>

## Gastroparesis
- chronic condition of delayed stomach emptying
	- nausea, vomiting, rapid fullness, reflux, pain, bloating
- diabetic gastroparesis caused by neuropathy of vagal endings innervating the stomach
- can lead to malnutrition, formation of bezoars (hardened mass of undigested food), changes to blood sugar
### Diagnosis
- gastric emptying study
- labelled C13 meal ingested
	- released C13 in breath is used as a marker of movement of food through the stomach
		- compare time with normal values
### Treatment
- domperidone or erythromycin
	- to stimulate muscle contracatoin
- antiemetics for nausea
- dietary changes (eat smaller, softer food more frequently)
## IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease)
- collective term that refers to chronic inflammation of lower GIT
	- Crohn's Disease
	- Ulcerative Colitis
- unknown cause
	- altered epithelial barrier integrity,
	- changes to microbial quorum,
	- gut-brain interactions e.g. cortisol released via stress mechanisms
	- genetic e.g. NOD2 gene variants associated with Crohn's disease
### Crohn's Disease (CD)
- usually localised to small bowel
- can affect the whole GIT

#### Diagnosis
- colonoscopy
	- ![gut health and disease-1740927565096.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%202/attachments/gut%20health%20and%20disease-1740927565096.webp)
- faecal calprotectin (>250ug/g): produced by neutrophils (migrating to mucosa)
#### Symptoms
- diarrhoea
- abdominal pain
- fatigue
- fever
- blood in stool
#### Complications
- changes in bowel epithelium leading to scarring
	- scarring can lead to bowel obstruction (fatal if untreated)
- ulcers in mouth and perineum
- fistulas - holes in the bowel
#### Treatments
##### Paediatric
- enteral nutrition for four weeks replacing the normal diet
- don't use steroids since they can impact growth
##### Adult
- corticosteroids short term - prednisolone, budenoside
- IBD immunosuppressants - azathioprine, mercaptopurine
- antibodies for TNF - infliximab, adalimumab
### Ulcerative Colitis (UC)
- chronic inflammation restricted to colon
![gut health and disease-1740928012378.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%202/attachments/gut%20health%20and%20disease-1740928012378.webp)
#### Diagnosis
- colonoscopy
	- ![gut health and disease-1740928076866.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%202/attachments/gut%20health%20and%20disease-1740928076866.webp)
	- damage to colonic epithelium leading to ulcer-like appearance of mucosa
#### Symptoms
- bloody diarrhoea
- urgency
- abdominal pain
- fatigue
- fever
- weight loss
#### Complications
- perforation of colon (can be fatal)
- severe bleeding
- dehydration
- systemic inflammation
- colon cancer
#### Treatment
##### Mild Symptoms
- 5-ASAs: aminosalicylates (sulphasalazine, mesalazine)
	- oral, suppository, enema
- corticosteroids - prednisolone
##### Severe Symptoms
- antibodies for TNF - infliximab, adalimumab
- ciclosporin -  IV
- surgery - colectomy to remove diseased/damaged colon
## Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)
- umbrella term for Functional Gastrointestinal Diseases (FGIDs) with unknown pathophysiology
	- upper FGIDs: functional GORD, functional dyspepsia, bloating, pain
	- lower FGIDs: abdominal pain, cramping, constipation, diarrhoea
- diagnosed via exclusion using a ROME IV questionnaire
- treat the symptoms
	- antidepressants
	- laxatives/fibre
	- pain medication e.g. pregabalin
- specific IBS treatments:
	- linaclotide: increase fluid secretion and pain relief
	- lubiprostone: increase fluid secretion
	- rifaximin: antibiotic to treat bacterial overgrowth
