# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Describe activation and transport of fatty acids into the mitochondrion for breakdown (catabolism)
- [ ] Outline the sequence of reactions involved in oxidation of fatty acids in the mitochondrion
- [ ] Describe hormonal activation of lipolysis in adipose tissue, and coordination with gluconeogenesis in the liver during fasting
- [ ] Explain the build-up (lipogenesis) of fatty acids and their main regulatory mechanisms

# Lipolysis in Adipose Tissue
- three key enzymes
## Adipose Triglyceride Lipase (ATGL)
- cleaves the triglyceride
	- into a diglyceride and fatty acid
## Hormone Sensitive Lipase (HSL)
- cleaves diglyceride
	- into monoglyceride and fatty acid
- activated by adrenaline and noradrenaline via beta receptors
	- cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA), phosphorylates perilipins, activating HSL
		- insulin degrades cAMP, thus inhibiting lipolysis
		- insulin activates phosphotase-1, reducing phosphorylations in adipose tissue
## Monoglyceride Lipase
- cleaves monoglyceride
	- into glycerol and fatty acid

# Beta Oxidation of Fatty Acids
- fatty acids found in plasma, bound to albumin
	- once in cytosol, FA bind to proteins and are moved to subcellular locations
		- react with coenzyme A ---acyl-coA synthetase (thiokinase)---> fatty acyl coA
			- converts an ATP into AMP

## Carnitine Shuttle
- movement of fatty acyl-coA from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix
- carnitine joins onto fatty acyl-coA via carnitine acyltransferase I (CAT I)
	- coA is cleaved off
	- fatty acyl carnitine is then transferred across the outer mitochondrial membrane into the intermembrane space
		- fatty acyl carnitine then goes through a transporter/carrier of the inner mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondrial matrix
			- carnitine acyltransferase II (CAT II) then cleaves off the carnitine and adds coA again, making fatty acyl-coA again 
				- beta oxidation to produce acetyl-coA
### Regulation of Carnitine Shuttle
- inhibited by malonyl-coA (product of conversion of acetyl-coA into fat)
- activated by glucagon through cAMP signalling to transport more fatty acyl-coA into the mitochondria 
## Beta Oxidation Steps (OHOT)
- one NADH and one FADH produced per cycle

# Lipogenesis
- citrate leaves Krebs cycle and mitochondrion; enters the cytosol
	- citrate broken down by **ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY)**
		- makes acetyl-coA + oxaloacetate + ADP
			-  acetyl-coA + HCO3 + ATP --> **malonyl-coA**
				- malonyl-coA converted into FA by **acetyl-coA carboxylase**
					- fatty acid synthase chains together malonyl-coA to grow the FA chain

## Regulation of Lipogenesis
- regulation of **acetyl-coA carboxylase (ACCA)**
	- polymerisation of enzyme in the presence of citrate (active)
		- depolymerisation of enzyme in presence of palmitoyl-coA (inactive)
	- phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent kinases renders ACCA inactive
		- insulin opposes phosphorylation and makes it active
