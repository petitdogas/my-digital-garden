# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Recognise and describe different gastric secretions and how they control the chemical environment
- [ ] Describe and explain neural and endocrine control gastric function
- [ ] Describe and explain pathophysiology and complications gastro-oesophageal reflux disease including Barret's oesophagus
- [ ] Describe and explain pathophysiology peptic ulcer disease and role Helicobacter Pylori in gastric disease

# Role of Gastric Secretions
- kill pathogens
- absorption of vitamin B12 - intrinsic factor
- aid in absorption minerals
- appetite regulation
- digestion of food without digesting the stomach

# Hormones
## Gastrin
### In Stomach
- stimulates HCl production
- released from antrum G cells in response to food, decreased acid, partially digested proteins, and gastric distension
- binds to parietal and ECL cells in stomach corpus / body
- Gastrin also binds to chief cells – release pepsinogen
### In Duodenum
- secreted by epithelial G cells in duodenum
- stimulated by high peptide / amino acid load in duodenal chyme
- stimulates parietal cells and ECL cells
- increased acid, increased pepsinogen
### Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome - too much gastrin
- gastric acid hypersecretion
- ectopic secretion of gastrin by neuroendocrine tumour
- severe gastroesophageal peptic ulcer disease
## Secretin
- secreted by epithelial S cells in duodenum
- increase production of bicarbonate from pancreas
- inhibits gastric acid secretion after entry of fat and acid into duodenum - reduces acid
	- inhibition of antral gastrin release
	- stimulation of [[Medical School/Year 1/met/week 2/gastric secretions#Gastric Phase\|somatostatin release]]
	- direct downregulation of parietal cell proton secretion

# Cells Involved in Gastric Secretions
![gastric secretions-1739877141692.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%202/attachments/gastric%20secretions-1739877141692.webp)
## Mucous Cells
- secrete bicarbonate to protect us against the high acidity within the lumen
	- without mucous, acid would cause pain and tissue damage
- physical gel barrier
- can be disrupted by alcohol, NSAIDs, aspirin
## Chief Cells
- make pepsinogen
## Parietal Cells
- intrinsic factor - vitamin B12 absorption
- acid production
### How parietal cells make acid - the proton pump
- stimulated parietal cells insert proton pump into cell membrane
- proton pump located on parietal cell apical  membrane 
- driven by energy released by ATP

## Enteroendocrine Cells
- make histamine, which acts on parietal cells to make acid
### Enterochromaffin like cells (ECL)
### G cells
- in gastric antrum
### D cells
- in gastric antrum
# Stages of Digestion
![gastric secretions-1739878509067.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%202/attachments/gastric%20secretions-1739878509067.webp)
## Cephalic Phase
- mediated entirely by the vagus nerve (CN X)
	- Ach acts on **parietal cells** to increase acid production
	- Ach acts on **ECL cells** to release histamine to signal to parietal cells to produce even more acid
	- Ach acts on chief cells to release **pepsinogen**
	- stimulation of G cells to release gastrin by GRP
- amounts for about 20-50% post prandial acid secretion
## Gastric Phase
- continued secretion of HCl, gastrin, pepsinogen
	- stimulus is different - **mechanoreceptors and chemical receptors** within the stomach (sensory afferent nerve off vagus)
		- sensing the levels of proteins / physical movement of chyme
### Inhibition
- inhibited by **Somatostatin (SST)** - central inhibitor of acid secretion
	- important because we do not want high acidity in the duodenum
	- made by antral D cells
		- secretion stimulated by low antral pH
		- secretion inhibited by Ach
	- binds to parietal cells, decreasing response to histamine - ==direct==
	- binds to ECL cells, inhibiting release of histamine - ==indirect==
	- inhibits gastric motility (so chyme moves slower into duodenum)
- **prostaglandins PGE2 and PGI2**
	- decrease acid production
	- COX inhibition by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) augments acid secretion and induces gastric mucosal lesions under fasted conditions
## Intestinal Stage
- feedback and satiation
- triggered mainly by chemoreceptor activation in the small bowel
# Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GORD)
![gastric secretions-1739878862521.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%202/attachments/gastric%20secretions-1739878862521.webp)
![gastric secretions-1739878716649.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%202/attachments/gastric%20secretions-1739878716649.webp)
- lower oesophageal sphincter relaxes too much, causing reflux
- risk factors
	- excessive reflux of normal gastric juice
		- increased frequency of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations
	- weakened lower oesophageal sphincter
	- histal hernia
	- obesity
	- family history of GORD
## Symptoms
- heartburn - burning midsternal sensation
- acid reflux - sour or bitter taste, mainly after meals
- extra-oesophageal symptoms
	- cough
	- laryngitis
	- asthma
	- dental erosion
- may be asymptomatic
## Treatment
- Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)
	- do not fix the underlying pathophysiology
		- just makes the acid less acidic, so less damage
- avoid NSAIDs/aspirin (since they make the acid more acidic)
	- ![gastric secretions-1739879082099.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%202/attachments/gastric%20secretions-1739879082099.webp)
## Complication - Barret's Oesophagus
- normal epithelium of the oesaphagus is squamous
	- after constantly being exposed to acid, they change shape - metaplasia
		- they become columnar epithelium and goblet cells
		- increases risk of dysplasia, so increased risk of malignancy
			- development of oesophageal adenocarcinoma
- patients presenting with **dysphagia** should be investigated

# Helicobacter pylori
- major cause of peptic ulcer
- four stages
	- tunnel through mucous layer
	- secrete ammonia to neutralise pH
		- uses urease, which acts on urea in gastric juices
	- recruit more helicobacter pylori
	- mucosal damage
## Diagnosis
- urea breath test - give C<sup>13</sup> and test for production of C<sup>13</sup>O<sub>2</sub> 
- CLO test (Campylobacter-like organism test)
	- biopsy placed in media with urea and pH indicator conversion of urea to ammonia raises pH 
- blood antibody test
- stool antigen test
## Complications
- chronic atrophic gastritis causing achlorhydria 
	- impairs absorption of vitamin B12, iron, calcium, zinc
- increased risk for gastric adrenocarcinoma
- increased risk for Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD)

# Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD)
- break in mucosal lining of stomach to level submucosa (minimum)
- Imbalance between factors promoting mucosal damage -gastric acid, pepsin, Helicobacter pylori infection, NSAIDS, smoking and mechanisms promoting gastroduodenal defence -  prostaglandins, mucous, bicarbonate, mucosal blood flow
## Treatment
- vagotomy
	- reduces Ach secretion from eneteric neurones, reducing acid secretion
- histamine agonists (H2) - ranitidine
	- block histamine receptors on parietal cells
- PPIs (proton pump inhibitors) - omeprazole
	- prevent H+/K+ ATPase on parietal cell
- antibiotics
