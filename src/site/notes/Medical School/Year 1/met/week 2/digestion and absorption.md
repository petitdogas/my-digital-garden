# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Recognise and describe anatomy small intestine; anatomical features of small intestine relevant to digestion and absorption.
- [ ] Recognise and describe physiology of accessory organs digestions.
- [ ] Describe and explain anatomical features of the colon relative to absorption.
- [ ] Describe and explain absorption of different nutrients: carbohydrates; protein; fats.
- [ ] Describe and explain causes of general malabsorption and specific, named examples of malabsorption.

# Ingestion
- voluntary
- mastication - mechanical digestion
- tongue - transit + lingual lipase
- salivary glands - moisture + amylase + antibacterial
- mouth --> oesophagus --> stomach
	- deglutition (swallowing)

# Pancreatic Juice
- trypsin activated by enterokinase, triggering activation of other pancreatic enzymes (they are stored as zymogens)
- beans have pancreatic trypsin inhibitor
# Small Intestine
## Duodenum
- absorption of iron, calcium, and zinc
- Brunner's glands produce bicarbonate 
- goblet cells - secrete mucous
- crypts of LieberkÃ¼hn - cells producing secretin, enteropeptidase
- bile and pancreatic enzymes enter the duodenum via the hepatopancreatic duct
	- where the pancreatic duct and common bile duct converge
## Jejunum
- mechanical digestion continues and predominates
- major site of absorption
- vascular supply is superior mesenteric artery
## Ilium
### Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)
- salivary glands release haptocorrin, which binds to B12 and protects it in the stomach
	- reaches small intestine, and stops binding to haptocorrin
		- instead binds to intrinsic factor (made by parietal cells of the stomach)
			- absorbed in terminal ilium via receptor-mediated endocytosis

# Digestion and Absorption of Biomolecules
## Carbohydrates
- salivary amylase begins starch digestion
- pancreatic amylase
	- digests starch to oligosaccharides
		- oligosaccharides hydrolysed by brush border enzymes
- glucose transported by secondary active transport with Na+ into enterocyte
- sucrase + isomaltase - glucose released is taken in by SGLT-1 and fructose by GLUT5
- lactase - glucode taken in by SGLT-1
## Proteins
- free amino acids absorbed via secondary active transport with Na+
- dipeptides and tripeptides transported via secondary active transport with H+ into cytoplasm
	- hydrolysed into free amino acids and then secreted into the blood
## Fats
- large lipid droplets mixed + bile salts --> micelles
	- micelles + pancreatic lipase --> fatty acids + monoglycerides
- within enteric cell, synthesis of triglycerides and formation of chylomicrons
	- chylomicrons too large to go through capillaries, so use lymphatic system instead

# Large Intestines
- conversion of chyme into faeces
	- absorption of water and electrolytes on the right side
