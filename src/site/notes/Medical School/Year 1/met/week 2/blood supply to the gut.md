# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Understand the anatomy and distribution of the 3 unpaired arteries of the abdominal aorta
- [ ] Describe the blood supply to the liver and explain the formation of the hepatic portal vein
- [ ] Review autonomic nerve supply to the gut

# The Gut Tube and Divisions
## Foregut
- supplied by the coeliac trunk (T12)
	- trifurcates into
		- left gastric artery
		- splenic artery
		- common hepatic artery

## Midgut

- supplied by superior mesenteric artery (L1)
	- inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery
	- jejunal and ileal branches
## Jejunum or Ileum

### Jejunum
![blood supply to the gut-1739882397275.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%202/attachments/blood%20supply%20to%20the%20gut-1739882397275.webp)
- longer vasa recta
- fewer arcades
- more vascular
- less fat in mesentery
- more plicare circulares
- larger lumen
### Ileum
- shorter vasa recta
- more arcades
- more fat in mesentery
- more plicae circulares
- smaller lumen
- Peyer's patches

## Hindgut
![blood supply to the gut-1739882690902.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%202/attachments/blood%20supply%20to%20the%20gut-1739882690902.webp)
- supplied by inferior mesenteric artery (L3)
	- left colic artery
		- linked to middle colic artery by the marginal artery
	- sigmoidal artery
	- superior rectal artery

# Hepatic Portal Vein
- anterior to inferior vena cava
![blood supply to the gut-1739882993762.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%202/attachments/blood%20supply%20to%20the%20gut-1739882993762.webp)
- blood from foregut drains via splenic vein
- venous blood from midgut drains via superior mesenteric vein
- blood from hindgut drains via inferior mesenteric vein

# Nerve Supply to the Gut
## Visceral
- sensory and motor components
	- motor components are autonomic
		- sympathetic (CN III, VII, IX, X and S2-4) inhibits digestion
		- parasympathetic (CN X) stimulates digestion (sacral nerves in hindgut - pelvic splanchnic nerves)
### Sympathetic Chain
![blood supply to the gut-1739883353908.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%202/attachments/blood%20supply%20to%20the%20gut-1739883353908.webp)
