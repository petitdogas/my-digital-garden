# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Explain why gluconeogenesis is not simply a reversal of glycolysis. (3 irreversible steps in glycolysis that need another enzyme or pathway)
- [ ] Describe the role of pyruvate metabolism in gluconeogenesis
- [ ] Discuss the role of gluconeogenesis in exercise and starvation (Cori cycle)
- [ ] How is glucose made form glycerol and amino acids
- [ ] Control of gluconeogenesis by the 3 key hormones
- [ ] What goes wrong in that process in untreated diabetes

# Irreversible Steps

- pyruvate --> PEP
- F1,6BP --> F6P via fructose-1,6-bisphosphotase
- G6P --> glucose via glucose-6-phosphotase
## Pyruvate Metabolism
- pyruvate in mitochondrion
- **pyruvate carboxylase** (uses ATP) --> oxaloacetate
	- oxaloacetate reduced (using NADH) --> malate with the enzyme malate dehydrogenase
		- malate transported out of mitochondrion to cytosol
			- malate converted back into oxaloacetate (using NAD) with the enzyme **malate dehydrogenase**
				- **decarboxylation** of oxaloacetate (GTP-->GDP) into PEP
- oxaloacetate (lacks transporters in the mitochondria)
- malate (can be transported out of mitochondria)
- require 1 ATP and 1 GTP molecule
- pyruvate carboxylase, malate dehydrogenase
# Starting Materials for Gluconeogenesis

## Sources of Carbon
- lactate from muscles (glycolysis)
- glyceral from fat breakdown (lipolysis)
- amino acids from proteolysis 
## Sources of Energy
- ATP from glycolysis/krebs
- fatty acids - converted into acetyl-coA to generate ATP required for gluconeogenesis
	- acetyl-coA regulates pyruvate carboxylase (activates) and inhibits [[Medical School/Year 1/met/week 2/the tca cycle and the electron transport chain#Link Reaction\|pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC)]]

# Gluconeogenesis in Fasting and Exercise
- glucose --> lactate in anaerobic conditions
	- lactate goes to liver to be oxidised back to glucose by gluconeogenesis
		- interaction between liver and muscle is called the Cori Cycle

# Gluconeogenesis from Glycerol
- glycerol from triglycerides
	- glycerol then converted to **dihydroxyacetone phosphate** in the liver and kidneys only

# Gluconeogenesis from Amino Acids 
- proteolysis mainly in muscle
- alanine and glutamine 
- glucogenic amino acids can provide carbons for gluconeogenesis
- ketogenic amino acids (lysine and leucine) can be used in fatty acid metabolism to provide energy for gluconeogenesis

# Hormonal Control of Gluconeogenesis
- insulin inhibits gluconeogenesis and promotes glycolysis
	- activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase --> conversion into acetyl-coA
- cortisol promotes gluconeogenesis
- glucagon promotes gluconeogenesis by increasing activity of PDH kinase (so more pyruvate remains and can be converted into glucose)
