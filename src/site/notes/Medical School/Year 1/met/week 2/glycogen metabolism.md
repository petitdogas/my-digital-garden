# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Understand the importance of glycogen as storage of energy
- [ ] Describe the role of glycogen in glucose homeostasis
- [ ] Describe the structure of glycogen
- [ ] Understand the mechanisms of glycogen production and regulation of key enzymes
- [ ] Describe the mechanisms of glycogen breakdown and how key enzymes are controlled
- [ ] Explain the different roles of glycogen storage in muscle and liver
- [ ] Understand the effects of alterations of glycogen metabolism

# Glycogenesis Steps
## Phosphoglucomutase
- glucose --- glucokinase ---> G6P --- phosphoglucomutase ---> G1P
## UDP-Glucose Pyrophosphorylase
- UDP + G1P --- UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase ---> UDP-glucose + pyrophosphate (2 Pi)
	- pyrophosphatase releases energy to allow next step
## UDP-Glucose + Glycogenin
- no enzyme (autoglycosylation) adds the UDP-glucose to the base **glycogenin**
- UDP is released
## Glycogen Synthase
- glycogen synthase is activated when **dephosphorylated**
	- switched on by protein phosphatase-1
	- switched off by PKA (protein kinase A)
- takes UDP-glucose and adds it to the chain (1,4-glycosidic bonds)
	- UDP is released
- this builds up a very long chain
## Branching Enzyme
- breaks down some of the 1,4-glycosidic bonds and sticks them to the molecule to make 1,6-glycosidic bonds
	- makes glycogen

# Glycogenolysis Steps
## Glycogen Phosphorylase
- switched on by **cAMP/PKA**
- switched off by Akt
- breaks 1,4-glycosidic bonds up until the glucose molecule a couple positions away from the 1,6-glycosidic bonds
- forms G1P
### Phosphoglucomutase
- converts the G1P to G6P
### Glucose-6-Phosphotase
- converts G6P --> glucose
- only in liver, kidneys, parts of GI tract
## Debranching Enzyme
- breaks a 1,4-glycosidic bond between the 1,6-glucose and the glucose it has a 1,4-glycosidic bond
	- then transfers this chain of glucoses onto another branch
- breaks the 1,6-glycosidic bond, releasing a glucose molecule

# Glycogen Storage Diseases
## GSD V (McArdle Disease)
- autosomal recessive
- myophosphorylase affected
## GSD VI (Hers Disease)
- liver glycogen phosphorylase affected
- autosomal recessive
