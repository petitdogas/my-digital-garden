# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Discuss the TCA cycle with respect to oxidative metabolism and ATP synthesis
- [ ] Discuss the control of the TCA cycle
- [ ] Explain the significance of the biosynthetic role of the TCA cycle
- [ ] Describe the reciprocal interaction between the metabolism of glucose and fatty acids
- [ ] Discuss how cells adapt metabolically to hypoxia

# Link Reaction
- catalysed by the **pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH)**
	- members of the B Vitamin family (Vitamin B1)
- unidirectional - loss of CO2
- NAD+ --> NADH
- forms acetyl-coA
## Control of PDH
- de/phosphorylation of PDH to de/activate the complex
	- kinases inhibit; phosphatases activate
- end product inhibition (acetyl-coA and NADH)
- ATP, acetyl-coA, and ADH activate PDH kinase (which will then deactivate PDH)
- calcium (muscle) and insulin activate PDH phosphatase (activating PDH) 
### Hormones
- insulin activates PDH phosphatase and inhibits PDH kinase
	- thus activating PDH, so more acetyl-coA produced
- adrenaline and glucagon (cAMP) activate PDH kinase
	- important for gluconeogenesis 

# Electron Transport Chain Complexes
- complex 1: oxidises NADH to NAD + and transfers its electrons **ubiquinone**
- complex 2: oxidises FADH to FAD and transfers electrons to **ubiquinone**
- complex 3: transfers electrons from **ubiquinone** to **cytochrome C**
- complex 4: transfers electrons from **cytochrome C** to oxygen to produce water

> [!TIP]- NB:
> complexes 1,3 and 4 can transfer protons from matrix to the intermembrane space, creating a proton gradient

# Control of the TCA Cycle
- end product inhibition (ATP and NADH)
- enzymes activated by calcium (skeletal muscle contractions) to generate more ATP
	- **alpha-ketoglutarate-dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase**
- substrate regulation
	- cycle depends on availability of oxaloacetate, NAD+, and acetyl-coA

# TCA Cycle during Hypoxia
- formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
- in response to hypoxia, cells:
	- limit the amount of ATP needed (since it cannot produce ATP via the electron transport chain)
	- improve anaerobic ATP production efficiency 
	- limit oxidative stress (ROS) to prevent damage to tissues
- increased expression of **hypoxia-induced factors (HIF)**
	- in normoxic conditions, HIF1 is broken down
	- during hypoxic conditions, HIF1 moves to nucleus and acts as a transcription factor
		- increased production of GLUT, production of glycolytic enzymes, activation of PDH kinase (inhibits acetyl-coA production since there's no point when there's no oxygen)
	- HIF causes reduction in mitochondria by promoting autophagyand inhibits production of mitochondria by inhibiting PGC1
	- also an oncogene

# Leigh Syndrome
- symptoms:
	- appear usually in first year of life and result in death after 2/3 years
	- progressive loss of mental abilities and movement
	- damage to brain, nerves, and muscles leads to respiratory death
- pathology:
	- genetic mutation affecting the ETC --> can't make ATP --> loss of cell viability, causing death to cells (brain, nerves, muscles etc.)
