# Vitamins

## Water Soluble
- absorbed in small intestine with specific carriers then transported in blood
- limited body stores
- toxicity possible, but rarer
## Fat Soluble
- absorbed as chylomicrons
- large body stores
- toxicity possible
- involve cell membranes and altering gene expression in nucleus

# Micronutrient Deficiency
- can be the result of:
	- inadequate intake in diet (iron and vitamin A)
	- inadequate amounts in the food itself (iodine and selenium)
	- poor nutrient bioavailability (iron and zinc)
	- increased needs/loss (iron, folate)
	- malabsorption e.g. by IBD, [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 9/how does the immune system recognise pathogens#Coeliac Disease\|coeliac disease]], gastric bypass
	- medication interfering with metabolism/absorption - PPIs - iron, calcium, zinc
	- alcohol use disorder - thiamine deficiency
## Effect on Children
- iron deficiency impacts cognition
- vitamin A deficiency leads to blindness and death from measles
- iodine deficiency in pregnant women leads to Congenital Iodine Deficiency Syndrome (CIDS)
	- profoundly impaired cognitive and physical development

# Dietary Reference Values
## LRNI - Lower Reference Nutrient Intake   
- amount for only few people with low needs
- only about 2.5% of the population will have needs met
## EAR - Estimated Average Requirement
- enough for half the population
## RNI - Reference Nutrient Intake
- enough for about 97% of the population
## Safe Intakes
- adequate for almost everyone's needs
	- but not so large enough as to be toxic or have side effects
