# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Describe what ketone bodies are, the role of ketone bodies in energy and their regulation in metabolism
- [ ] Describe the clinical significance of ketone bodies
- [ ] Understand how glucose, fat and ketone bodies metabolism are inter-linked and how this network is tightly controlled
- [ ] Outline metabolic flexibility

# Ketogenesis
- beta oxidation of fatty acids leads to proudction of lots of acetyl-coA
- two acetyl-coA --- acetyl-coA acyl transferase ---> acetoacetyl-coA + coA
- acetoacetyl-coA + acetyl-coA --- HMG-coA synthase ---> HMG-coA + coA
- HMG-coA --- HMG-coA lyase ---> **acetoacetate** + acetyl-coA
	- acetoacetate can then be reduced into **beta hydroxybutyrate** via beta hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase
		- NADH --> NAD+
	- acetoacetate --- acetoacetate decarboxylase ---> **acetone**

# Function of Ketone Bodies
- used as fatty acids cannot cross the blood brain barrier
- mostly used by brain and muscles during starvation
- important in infants
	- breast milk contains mostly fats (which can undergo beta oxidation and then ketogenesis occurs)
		- 60% of newborn energy use is brain (but it's only 10% of mass)
		- therefore must be able to use ketone bodies to get most of the energy

# Ketone Bodies ---> Acetyl-coA
- beta hydroxybutyrate --- beta hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase ---> **acetoacetate**
	- NAD+ ---> NADH
- acetoacetate --- **SCOT** ---> acetoacetyl-coA
	- SCOT (enzyme) : succinyl-coA ---> succinate (the coA transfers onto the acetoacetate)
- acetoacetyl-coA --- **thiolase** ---> two acetyl-coA
	- beta oxidation

# Clinical Significance of Ketone Bodies
## Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)
- untreated diabetes causes excessively high levels of ketone bodies
	- released into blood, decreasing pH -- acidic
- insulin inhibits the enzymes which stop ketogenesis
- when ketone bodies are in excess, more acetone is produced
	- fruity breath
### Symptoms
- bad/fruity breath
- extreme thirst
- urination
- nausea
- vomiting
- lethargy
- confusion
- hyperventilation
### Treatment
- IV fluids
- replacement of electrolytes
- IV insulin
