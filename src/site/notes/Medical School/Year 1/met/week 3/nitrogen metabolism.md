# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Nitrogen homeostasis / balance
- [ ] Metabolic fate of amino acids
- [ ] Metabolic classification of amino acids
	- [ ] Ketogenic and gluconeogenic amino acids
- [ ] Importance of glutamate and related metabolites
- [ ] Excretion of surplus nitrogen (urea cycle)
- [ ] Some related conditions

# Function of Amino Acids
- makes DNA bases
- neurotransmitters (glutamate, glucine, aspartite directly and dopamine, adrenaline, noradrenaline indirectly)
- histamine from histadine
- nitric oxide from arginine
- serotonin from tryptophan
- related to Krebs cycle intermediates
- [[Medical School/Year 1/met/week 2/gluconeogenesis#Gluconeogenesis from Amino Acids\|glucogenic and ketogenic amino acids]]

## Amino Acids in Krebs

# Oxidative Deamination
- catabolism of amino acids can lead to the production of ammonia
	- e.g. glutamate --- glutamate dehydrogenase ---> alpha-ketoglutarate
		- NAD+ --> NADH
	- takes place in liver (mitochondria)

# Transamination
- many amino acids don't form ammonia directly
	- instead, transfer their amine group to alpha-ketoglutarate
		- forming glutamate
			- catalysed by aminotransferases/transaminases/aminotransaminases
				- these contain pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)
					- derived from Vitamin B6

# Glutamine in Renal Acid-Base Regulation

- in acidosis, [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 5/acid-base balance#Kidney regulation of acid-base balance\|kidneys excrete more protons]]
	- protons come from ammonium ions which come from glutamate
- in alkalosis, kidneys retain more protons
	- glutamine from blood is deaminated to glutamate, which forms alpha-ketoglutarate
		- ammonium converted to ammonia and then leaves via urine, where it is converted to ammonia again (since charged particles can't cross)

# Glucose-Alanine Cycle
![nitrogen metabolism-1740964853256.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%203/attachments/nitrogen%20metabolism-1740964853256.webp)
- muscles use LIV (leucine, isoleucine, valine) as fuel source
- amino groups in muscle form glutamate
	- glutamate converted to alpha-ketoglutarate (alanine transferase)
		- alanine then goes through the blood to the liver
			- reacts with alpha-ketoglutarate (alanine transferase) to make glutamate
				- makes NH4+ for urea
				- makes pyruvate for gluconeogenesis as well

# Urea Cycle
![nitrogen metabolism-1740965191074.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%203/attachments/nitrogen%20metabolism-1740965191074.webp)
- NH4+ reacts with CO2 to form carbamoyl phosphate
	- reacts with ornithine ---> citrulline
		- leaves mitochondria
			- citrulline + aspartine ---> arginosuccinate
				- degraded to arginine and fumarate
## Urea Cycle Defects
- any obstruction can lead to hyperammonaemia
	- after birth, lethargy and vomiting, followed by coma and death (hepatic encephalopathy)
		- treatment can be restricting protein diet / providing arginine
### Phenylketonuria (PKU)
![nitrogen metabolism-1740965684378.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%203/attachments/nitrogen%20metabolism-1740965684378.webp)
- unable to metabolise phenylalanine
	- missing/low **phenylalanine hydroxylase**
	- untreated leads to seizures, learning disability, hypopigmentation, "musty" smell
		- supplement with tyrosine
