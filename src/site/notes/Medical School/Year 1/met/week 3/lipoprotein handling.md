# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Outline the process of lipogenesis and its control
- [ ] Describe the structure and composition of the main classes of lipoproteins
- [ ] Describe the role of lipoprotein lipase
- [ ] Discuss Role of low-density lipoprotein in lipid handling
- [ ] Describe the contribution of Idl to atherogenesis and clinical treatments to lower serum LDL - cholesterol levels
- [ ] Discuss the significance of high-density lipoproteins (HDL)

# Function of Lipoproteins
- transport of hydrophobic lipids
- move triacylglycerides (TAGs) and cholesterol between liver, instestine, and tissues
# What are Lipoproteins?
- lipoproteins contain TAG, cholesterol, cholesterol esters, phospholipids and apolipoproteins
- cholesterol esters and TAG = hydrophobic, found in centre of particle
- free cholesterol, phospholipids and apolipoproteins are **amphipathic**
	- found on the outside of the molecule
- apolipoproteins bind lipids and are found on the surface - these can be exchanged between lipoproteins
	- structural and metabolic functions
- determine interactions with receptors on cells
- regulate enzyme activity to do with lipid transport and distribution
## Lipoprotein Classes

- chylomicrons - mainly triglycerides
	- formed in gut enterocytes during digestion
		- carry fat and cholesterol from GIT to skeletal, cardiac and adipose tissue via lymph then blood
- VLDL (very low density lipoproteins) - mainly triglycerides
	- formed in liver from excess fats and chylomicron leftovers
	- can give TAG to peripheral tissues
- IDL (intermediate density lipoproteins) - mainly triglycerides and cholesterol
	- formed from VLDLs that have given some of their TAG to peripheral tissues
- LDL - mainly cholesterol
	- made from remnants of VLDL and IDL
	- go back into circulation and deliver cholesterol to cells
- HDL - mainly protein
	- picks up cholesterol from peripheral cells
		- returns excess as cholesterol esters to liver to make VLDLs and LDLs

# Chylomicron Metabolism
- Apo C2 – allows chylomicron to give TAGs to peripheral cells – activates lipoprotein lipase
- Apo E – allows chylomicron remnant to be taken up by the liver to deliver fatty acids and cholesterol
- fats and cholesterol absorbed by GI tract form nascent chylomicrons (immature) and enter lymphatic circulation in post-absorptive phase
- nascent chylomicrons (with **only ApoA and ApoB48**) bind to HDL which donates **ApoC2** and **ApoE** to form mature chylomicrons (now has **ApoA, B48, C2, E**)
- apoprotein C2 binds to lipoprotein lipase and it allows chylomicrons to unload and transport triglceryides to cells after breaking it down into fatty acids 
- after unloading the triglycerides, it becomes a chylomicron remnant where Apoprotein E allows it to be taken up by the liver and form **VLDL or LDL**
