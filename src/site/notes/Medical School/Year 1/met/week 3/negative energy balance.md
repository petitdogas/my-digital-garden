# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Understand the role of muscle in metabolic regulation
- [ ] Metabolic pathways during physical activity
- [ ] Metabolic response to calorie restriction
- [ ] Metabolic effects of cancer
- [ ] Ethanol and energy metabolism

# Types of Muscle Fibre
- type I slow twitch, type IIa and IIb are fast twitch
	- IIa is for middle distance running and IIb for sprinting

# Types of Muscle Fibre
## Type I
- slow contraction time
- red due to myoglobin
- sustained force
- fuel is triglycerides
- high mitochondrial density
## Type II
- fast contraction time
- white due to absence of myoglobin
- sudden movement
- fuel is ATP
- low mitochondrial density

# Metabolic Demands During Exercise

NB: CP = creatine phosphate

## AMP Kinase (AMPK) activation

- AMP directly binds to AMP kinase
- Ca2+ influx --> calmodulin --> calcium-dependent protein kinase kinase beta --> AMPK

# Cancer effects on metabolism
- tumours express cytokines leading to cachexia
	- loss of appetite
	- increased proteolysis and decreased lipid synthesis
	- increased lipolysis, decreased lipogenesis and adipogenesis
## Warburg Effect
- upregulation of anaerobic glycolysis
	- increases lactate production
		- lactate incorporated into biomass
			- cell proliferation

# Ethanol Consumption

- when alcohol is processed, the NAD/NADP are used in processing ethanol instead of for the Krebs cycle
	- acetyl-coA does not go into the Kreb cycle, so converts into fatty acids --> triglycerides
