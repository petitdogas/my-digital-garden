# Learning Objectives
- [ ] To be able to identify the major anatomical features of the mouth
- [ ] To understand the motor nervous supply to the muscles of mastication, facial expression, soft palate, tongue, pharynx and oesophagus
- [ ] To understand the sensory nerve supply to the face, teeth, tongue and pharynx

# Relevant Cranial Nerves
- CN 5 - Trigeminal
- CN 7 - Facial
- CN 9 - Glossopharyngeal
- CN 10 - Vagus
- CN 12 - Hypoglossal

# Face / Mouth
## Lips

	- innervated by the facial nerve
- buccinator muscle (also innervated by facial nerve) is essentially the cheek

## CN 5 - Trigeminal Nerve

- three branches
	- opthalmic - V1
	- maxillary - V2
	- mandibular - V3

	- superior alveolar nerve and inferior alveolar nerve

## Muscles of Mastication
- innervated by the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve

### Temporalis
- elevation and restriction of jaw
### Masseter
- elevation and protrusion
### Lateral Pterygoid
- depression and protrusion
### Medial Pterygoid
- elevation and protrusion

## Salivary Glands
![mouth to oesophagus-20250211113135694.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%201/attachments/mouth%20to%20oesophagus-20250211113135694.png)
### Parotid gland
![mouth to oesophagus-20250211112954299.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%201/attachments/mouth%20to%20oesophagus-20250211112954299.png)
- innervated by glossopharyngeal nerve
- drains via the parotid duct
- enters mouth at the level of the second upper molar
## Submandibular gland
![mouth to oesophagus-20250211113009091.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%201/attachments/mouth%20to%20oesophagus-20250211113009091.png)
- innervated by the facial nerve
- drains into mouth either side of the frenulum of tongue
## Sublingual gland
![mouth to oesophagus-20250211113026174.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%201/attachments/mouth%20to%20oesophagus-20250211113026174.png)
- innervated by the facial nerve
- drains into mouth either side of the frenulum of tongue

## Tongue
- two groups of skeletal muscle covered by mucous membrane
	- intrinsic and extrinsic muscles
	- innervated by the **hypoglossal nerve**
![mouth to oesophagus-20250211113246222.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%201/attachments/mouth%20to%20oesophagus-20250211113246222.png)
### Sensory supply of the tongue
- posterior 1/3 and anterior 2/3
	- posterior 1/3 supplied by **glossopharyngeal** (special and general sensation)
	- anterior 2/3 special sensation by **chordae tympani (facial)** and general sensation by **lingual nerve (V3)**

## Hard Palate
- roof of mouth composed of bones
	- maxilla and palatine bones
## Soft Palate
![mouth to oesophagus-20250211114143407.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%201/attachments/mouth%20to%20oesophagus-20250211114143407.png)
- group of muscles covered by mucous membrane hanging off the soft palate
	- innervated by **vagus nerve**
- palatoglossal arch from soft palate to tongue
- palatopharyngeal arch from soft palate to pharynx
## Tonsils
- the palatine tonsils are collections of lymphoid tissue on each side of the oropharynx, between the palatine arches
	- ![mouth to oesophagus-20250211114216555.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%201/attachments/mouth%20to%20oesophagus-20250211114216555.png)
- lingual tonsil
## Pharynx
![mouth to oesophagus-20250211114447425.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%201/attachments/mouth%20to%20oesophagus-20250211114447425.png)
- sensory innervation is the **glossopharyngeal nerve**
- three divisions
	- nasopharynx
	- oropharynx
	- laryngopharynx
- constrictor muscles are all innervated by **vagus nerve**
	- ![mouth to oesophagus-20250211114543274.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%201/attachments/mouth%20to%20oesophagus-20250211114543274.png)
- stylopharyngeus
	- elevates the pharynx during swallowing
	- innervated by **glossopharyngeal nerve**

> [!TIP]- Gag Reflex
> The gag reflex is a response to touching the posterior pharyngeal wall **(glossopharyngeal nerve)** and involves a brisk and brief elevation of the soft palate and contraction of pharyngeal muscles **(vagus nerve)**.

# Oesophagus
- muscular tube connecting the pharynx to the stomach
	- internal circular muscle fibres
	- external longitudinal fibres
	- upper 1/3 skeletal muscle
	- lower 1/3 smooth muscle
- innervated by **vagus nerve (CN X)**
## Upper Oesophageal Sphincter
- anatomical sphincter produced by skeletal muscle
	- cricopharyngeus
## Lower Oesophageal Sphincter
- physiological sphincter
- osephagus enters the stomach at an acute angus
- the right crus of the diaphragm has a "pinch-cock" effect
## Constrictions of the Oesophagus
- cervical constriction
- thoracic constriction
- diaphragmatic constriction
