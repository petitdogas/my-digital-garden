# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Appreciate the immunological challenges associated with the intestine
- [ ] Be familiar with the immune anatomy of the intestine, including Peyer's patches
- [ ] Understand the structure and function of IgA antibodies
- [ ] Be familiar with the trafficking of T cells to the intestinal mucosa and understand the mechanisms involved
- [ ] Appreciate the role of the microbiota in shaping the intestinal immune system
- [ ] Have a basic understanding of intestinal inflammatory diseases arising from dysregulated responses to food (Coeliac disease) or microbes (Inflammatory Bowel Disease)

# Immune Cells in the Intestine

## Scattered Lymphoid Cells
- T and B cells
	- B cells making IgA
- CD4 and CD8 T cells present
	- CD4 - lamina propia
	- CD8 - intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs)
## Organised lymphoid tissues
### Peyer's Patches

- M cells transport antigen to underlying immune cells
- lymphocytes activated within the Peyer's patch move out to systemic circulation before coming back to the intestinal mucosa and populating it
### Mesenteric Lymph Nodes
### Isolated Lymphoid Follicles
