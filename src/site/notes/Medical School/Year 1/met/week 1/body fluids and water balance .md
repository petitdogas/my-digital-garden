# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Understand the role of water in the gut lumen and the body
- [ ] Name the main fluid compartments of the body, commenting on their volumes and predominant cations
- [ ] Explain how total body water and total body sodium are regulated by mechanisms that are sensitive to plasma volume and plasma osmolality
- [ ] Name the main types of failures of body fluid balance and understand their causes

# Why is water needed in the digestive system?
- hydrolysis reactions of digestion
- facilitation of absorption (brings products of digestion into close proximity to microvilli)
- facilitation of propulsion of gut contents
- combination with mucin granules to control mucus viscosity

# Secretory Crypt Cells
- cells at the crypt
- equipped with a sodium potassium pump
	- actively pumps sodium and potassium into crypt cells

- CFTR channel is dependent on cAMP
	- toxins (such as from cholera) can activate adenylate cyclase in crypt cells
		- so more cAMP
			- causing osmotic diarrhoea
# Regulation
## Hormones
### ADH
- makes cells of collecting duct and DCT permeable to water
### Angiotensin II and Aldosterone
- promote urinary resorption of Na+ and Cl- (as well as water by osmosis) when dehydrated
### ANP (Atrial Natriuretic Peptide)
- promote excretion of Na+ and Cl- (followed by water) to decrease blood volume

## CNS and Thirst Mechanism
![body fluids and water balance -1740503403620.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%201/attachments/body%20fluids%20and%20water%20balance%20-1740503403620.webp)
- increased **plasma osmolality** --> decreased saliva --> dry mouth, which feeds back to the hypothalamic thirst centre
- increased plasma osmolality is also detected by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus

# Failures of Body Fluid Balance
## Dehydration
- water intake is insufficient to cover water loss over a long period of time
	- water lost from the ECF and ICF
		- leads to weight loss, confusion, and fever
## Water Intoxication
- too much water intake too quickly or urine production blockage --> dilution of body fluids
	- decreased concentration of Na+ in ECF
		- osmotic shift of water into cells
			- cells swell (dangerous in brain and vital organs)
## Oedema

# Oedema
- abnormal accumulation of fluid in interstitial spaces due to
	- imbalance in hydrostatic and oncotic pressures
	- increased capillary permeability
	- impaired lymphatic drainage
## increased capillary hydrostatic pressure
- deep venous thromboembolism
![microcirculation and oedema-20241213114318296.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/cr/week%202/attachments/microcirculation%20and%20oedema-20241213114318296.webp)
- lower extremity pitting oedema from biventricular heart failure
![microcirculation and oedema-20241213114344036.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/cr/week%202/attachments/microcirculation%20and%20oedema-20241213114344036.webp)
- pregnancy especially in final trimester may cause lower extremity oooedema from increased HP
## decreased plasma oncotic pressure
- nephrotic syndrome, liver disease (synthesises albumin), malnutrition (severe)
- nephrotic syndrome – lose albumin through kidney.
	- increased oedema in tissues diffusely but prominent around eyes -  loose connective tissue - especially in children (adults less elastic connective tissue around eyes)
- kwashiorkor – protein malnutrition – low albumin
## increased capillary permeability
- allergy, inflammation, ACE inhibitors, burns and toxins
- reaction to ACE inhibitor – angioedema
	- ACE inhibitors increase bradykinin – increase capillary permeability as cells contract and intracellular spaces get bigger
- burns increase capillary permeability through several mechanisms, including direct cell damage, and inflammatory response so immune cells can reach damaged area
- cellulitis is a skin infection – oedema is due to both increased capillary permeability and increased hydrostatic pressure from vasodilation, but primary cause is increased capillary permeability
## lymphatic obstruction
- cancer obstructing lymphatics, surgery, trauma, infection
![microcirculation and oedema-20241213114824743.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/cr/week%202/attachments/microcirculation%20and%20oedema-20241213114824743.webp)
## myxoedema
- hypothyroidism
- oedema from accumulation glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) - long chains of sugar molecules – in interstitial tissue that attract and bind water molecules
- non-pitting
	- fluid is not free in tissue but rather bound within matrix of GAGs 
		- creating gel-like consistency that doesn't easily displace under pressure
