- [ ] Other functions

# Effect of Insulin on the Liver
- promotes glycogen synthesis
- suppresses gluconeogenesis
- accelerates glycolysis
	- increase fatty acid synthesis (with the rest of the acetyl-coA made)
## Insulin resistance is a feature of type 2 diabetes
- increased glucose (activates ChREBP)
	- de novo lipogenesis (SREBP1, FASN)
	- activates PKC& (inhibits insulin receptor tyrosine kinase)
- inappropriate gluconeogenesis
	- FOXO1-mediated
- impaired glycogen synthesis (muscle and liver)
	- Akt2-mediated
- impaired suppression of lipolysis in adipocytes
	- glycerol and FFA

# Lipids and the Liver
- triglycerides --> fatty acid + glycerol
	- fatty acid --> acetyl-coA
		- respiration
		- cholesterol synthesis
	- glycerol --> glucose
		- gluconeogenesis
- converts excess glucose to fatty acids
	- SREBP-1c
	- ChREBP
- synthesis of phospholipids
- ketogenesis
## Ketogenesis
- in absence of glucose (starvation)
	- therefore switched off by insulin
- breakdown of lipids and proteins
- use of acetyl-coA to produce ketone bodies
- liver produces:
	- VLDL in ‘plenty’
	- ketones in ‘starvation’

# Protein Metabolism
## Transamination
- transfer of amino group to a keto-acid
![image-4.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%201/attachments/image-4.webp)
- enzymes are alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT and AST)
	- measured in blood to test state of liver
		- elevated in blood means must be leaking from somewhere
## Deamination

- alpha-ketoglutarate for krebs cycle
- produces ammonium
### Effects of Ammonia
- excess ammonia depletes cells of alpha-ketoglutarate
- excess NH3 in astrocytes leads to excess glutamine
	- increased osmotic pressure, so astrocyte swelling
### Removal of Ammonia
- NH3 reduced to NH4+ converted to urea
	- therefore raised serum urea 

# Biliary Anatomy

## Bile Production
- up to 800ml bile daily
- secreted by hepatocytes in canaliculi
- modified by cholangiocytes
	- addition of HCO3+
### Hormones
- cholecystokinin (CCK)
	- fatty acids in lumen of duodenum
	- gall bladder contraction
	- sphincter of Oddi relaxation
- secretin
	- acid chyme in duodenum
	- stimulates biliary ductal cells
## Bile Salts
- detergents
- absorption of lipophilic substances
	- fatty acids
	- monoglycerides
	- cholesterol
	- fat soluble vitamins (A,D,E & K)
## Enterohepatic Circulation of Bile
![image-7.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%201/attachments/image-7.webp)
- reabsorption of bile!!
## Bilirubin
- RBC broken down in spleen after 120 days
	- heme element broken down into biliverdin --> bilirubin
		- bilirubin bound to albumin
			- conjugated to glucuronate
### Jaundice
- yellowing of skin and sclera due to excess bilirubin

# Liver Failure
- hypoglycaemia
- reduced albumin
- impaired clotting
- jaundice
- hyperammonaemia (encephalopathy)
