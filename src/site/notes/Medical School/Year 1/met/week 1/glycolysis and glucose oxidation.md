# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Describe mechanisms of glucose uptake, indicating differences in types of transport and differences in cell context
- [ ] Outline the potential metabolic fate of glucose-6-phosphate
- [ ] Outline the differences and similarities between glucokinase and hexokinase enzymes
- [ ] Describe the regulatory role of phosphoructo kinase enzyme in glycolysis
- [ ] Distinguish between the first 5 steps of glycolysis and the last 5 steps
- [ ] Describe how glucose generates ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation
- [ ] Relate glycolysis to the metabolism of fructose, glycerol and pentose sugars

# GLUT
- **GLUT1** - high in erythrocytes and BBB endothelial cells
- **GLUT2** - liver, pancreas, small intestine - acts as a glucose sensor (high Km)
- **GLUT3** - in neurones and placenta
- **GLUT4** - muscle and adipose cells - controlled by insulin
	- bound to vesicles in cells which fuse with cell membrane once signalled by insulin

# Steps of Glycolysis
## Phosphorylation of Glucose
- glucose --> glucose-6-phosphate (G6P)
- ATP --> ADP
- hexokinase
- feedback inhibition
### in liver and pancreas
- glucokinase used as enzyme
- responds quicker to changes in glucose levels
- no feedback inhibition
- regulated by **glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP)**
	- makes glycogen at high glucose concentrations
## Isomerisation of G6P --> F6P
- glucose-6-phosphate --> fructose-6-phosphate
- phosphoglucose isomerase
## Phosphorylation of F6P --> F1,6BP
- fructose-6-phosphate --> fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
- rate-limiting step
- regulated by enzyme **phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1)**
- ATP --> ADP
### control of PFK1
- activated allosterically by high AMP/ADP levels
- activated allosterically by **PFK2** (since it makes F-2,6BP which stimulates PFK1)
- inhibited by high ATP levels, citrate, and H+
## Breakdown of F1,6BP --> G3P + DHP
- fructose-1,6-bisphosphate --> glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate + dihydroxyacetone phosphate
- catalysed by aldolase
## Isomerisation of DHP --> G3P
- now we have 2x G3P
- triose phosphate isomerase
## Adding an Inorganic Phosphate x2
- dehydrogenase catalyses addition of phosphate to G3P
	- 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate 
- NAD+ --> NADH
## ATP Production x2
- 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate --> 3-phosphoglycerate
- ADP + Pi --> ATP
- **phosphoglycerate kinase**
- (net 0 ATP at this point)
## 3-phosphoglycerate --> 2-phosphoglycerate
- **phosphoglycerate mutase**
	- one of the intermediates is [[Medical School/Year 1/cr/week 3/carriage of oxygen and carbon dioxide in blood#2,3,-DPG effect\|2,3-DPG]]
## Dehydration
- removal of water produces phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)
	- can also be produced by gluconeogenesis
- enzyme is **enolase**
	- can be inhibited by fluoride ions (think about toothpaste acting on bacteria!!)
## PEP --> Pyruvate x2
- pyruvate kinase x2
- ADP + Pi --> ATP

# What happens to pyruvate?
- if oxygen is present
	- pyruvate is catalysed to acetyl-CoA
		- by pyruvate dehydrogenase
- if oxygen is scarce
	- glycolysis could stop if NAD+ is not regenerated from NADH
		- pyruvate can act as the electron acceptor and be reduced to lactate
			- NADH is re-oxidised to NAD+
				- catalysed by lactate dehydrogenase

# Interaction with Glycerol
- glycerol converted into **dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP)** for step four of glycolysis
- glycerol converted to glycerol-3-phosphate by glycerol kinase (mainly in liver)
	- oxidised into DHAP, releasing another NADH (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase)

# Interaction with Fructose
- fructose acted on by hexose kinase --> F6P
- in liver, there is fructokinase which converts fructose to fructose-1-phosphate
	- converted immediately to DHAP and glyceraldehyde by aldolase B
## Essential Hepatic Fructosuria
- autosomal recessive genetic condition caused by mutations in KHK gene (ketohexokinase gene)
	- causes **fructokinase deficiency**
		- unable to process fructose --> diarrhoea
## Hereditary fructose intolerance
- deficiency in **aldolase B**
- can kill liver cells

# Interaction with Pentose Phosphate Pathway
- important in liver and red blood cells
- products are ribose-5-phosphate and NADPH
- also produces G3P and F6P, both of which can feed into glycolysis
