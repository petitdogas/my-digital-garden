# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Basic elements of control
- [ ] Movements of oesophagus, stomach & intestine during hunger and after eating
- [ ] Introduction to reflex control & feedback regulation
- [ ] The peristaltic reflex
- [ ] Different movements of the colon

# Basic Units of Control
- smooth muscle
- interstitial pacemaker cells
- enteric nervous system
- extrinsic innervation
- hormonal influences
## Interstitial Cells of Cajal (ICCs)
- depolarise spontaneously
	- allows for smooth muscle to move by itself
- connected to smooth muscle by gap junctions
### When Eating
- vagal afferents signal to brain
	- vagal efferents then activate enteric neurones
		- enteric neurones stimulate muscle movement in the stomach, facilitated by slow waves
### When Fasting
- slow waves occur when stomach empty
- no peristalsis
## Enteric Nervous System
![image-1.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%201/attachments/image-1.webp)
### Myenteric Plexus
- primary motility controller (innervates muscle)
### Submucosal Plexus
- primary fluid exchange controller (innervates vascular and epithelial layer of mucosa)
### Mucosa
- sensory and motor nerve endings
### Peristalsis
![image.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%201/attachments/image.webp)
- ascending wave is excitatory (i.e. acetylcholine release)
- descending wave is inhibitory (usually via nitric oxide)
## Extrinsic Innervation of the Gut
![image-2.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%201/attachments/image-2.webp)
- has sensory and motor functions
- neurotransmitter from extrinsic efferent nerve terminals can act on pacemaker cells, the enteric nervous system, and endocrine cells
## Gastrointestinal Hormones
- stomach
	- [[Medical School/Year 1/bb/week 3/neural control of basic drives#Ghrelin\|ghrelin]] - increases appetite
	- gastrin - secretes acid
- duodenum
	- cholecystokinin - gall bladder contraction, pancreatic exocrine secretion, GI motility
	- secretin - pancreatic exocrine secretion
	- motilin - GI motility
- pancreas
	- [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 5/homeostasis#Insulin\|insulin]] and [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 5/homeostasis#Glucagon\|glucagon]]
	- pancreatic polypeptide - gastric motility, satiation
	- amylin - glucose homeostasis, gastric motility
- colon (and small intestine)
	- GLP-1 - incretin activity, satiation
	- GLP-2 - GI motility and growth
	- oxyntomodulin - satiation, acid secretion 

# Hunger - Migrating Motor Complex
![gut motility-1740144627422.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%201/attachments/gut%20motility-1740144627422.webp)
- three phases every 120 minutes
- vagus-dependent in stomach; vagus-independent in small intestine
- mediated by ENS
- clears undigested material
- prevents bacteria overgrowth
- leads to hunger sensations (phase three is your rumbling tummy)

# Food Intake

# Stages of Digestion
![gastric secretions-1739878509067.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%202/attachments/gastric%20secretions-1739878509067.webp)
## Cephalic Phase
- mediated entirely by the vagus nerve (CN X)
	- Ach acts on **parietal cells** to increase acid production
	- Ach acts on **ECL cells** to release histamine to signal to parietal cells to produce even more acid
	- Ach acts on chief cells to release **pepsinogen**
	- stimulation of G cells to release gastrin by GRP
- amounts for about 20-50% post prandial acid secretion
## Gastric Phase
- continued secretion of HCl, gastrin, pepsinogen
	- stimulus is different - **mechanoreceptors and chemical receptors** within the stomach (sensory afferent nerve off vagus)
		- sensing the levels of proteins / physical movement of chyme
### Inhibition
- inhibited by **Somatostatin (SST)** - central inhibitor of acid secretion
	- important because we do not want high acidity in the duodenum
	- made by antral D cells
		- secretion stimulated by low antral pH
		- secretion inhibited by Ach
	- binds to parietal cells, decreasing response to histamine - ==direct==
	- binds to ECL cells, inhibiting release of histamine - ==indirect==
	- inhibits gastric motility (so chyme moves slower into duodenum)
- **prostaglandins PGE2 and PGI2**
	- decrease acid production
	- COX inhibition by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) augments acid secretion and induces gastric mucosal lesions under fasted conditions
## Intestinal Stage
- feedback and satiation
- triggered mainly by chemoreceptor activation in the small bowel

## Central (Vagal) Control of Peristalsis in the Oesophagus
- wave of pressure and muscle contractions pushing bolus down the oesophagus
- primary peristaltic wave on swallowing - striated muscle; vagus
	- stimulates stretch receptors
		- local response causes secondary peristaltic wave - smooth muscle; ENS
- lower oesophageal sphincter opens up so that food can go in
	- stomach also relaxes to let the food in
		- receptive relaxation - vago-vagal reflex
			![gut motility-1740145144126.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%201/attachments/gut%20motility-1740145144126.webp)
		- adaptive relaxation - enteric reflex releases NO from ENS
## Gastric Emptying
- emptying of liquids is fast and exponential
- emptying of large, solid particles after lag face (once ground into viscous chyme)
![gut motility-1740145640705.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%201/attachments/gut%20motility-1740145640705.webp)
### Consequences of Gastric Emptying
- nutrients need to be absorbed
- defensive measures initiated (vomit) if needed
- feedback regulation (intestine to stomach) begins
- hunger returns
## Absorption of Nutrients
- small intestine
	- villi (highest concentration in duodenum/jejunum)
	- supportive network of capillaries draining into portal vein
## Feedback Regulation of Gastric Emptying
- duodenum picks up nutrients and releases **cholecystokinine (CCK)**
	- activates the vagal afferent
		- efferent activation
			- reduces emptying of pyloric sphincter
			- reduces contraction corpus-antrum
			- enhances relaxation of fundus
- if fats reach the ileum (if too many, so not digested fast enough)
	- gastric emptying slowed, inducing satiety
		- GLP-1
## Hunger Returns
- [[Medical School/Year 1/bb/week 3/neural control of basic drives#Ghrelin\|ghrelin]] released by stomach

# Colon and Rectum
## Movements of the Colon
![gut motility-1740146664059.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%201/attachments/gut%20motility-1740146664059.webp)
## Ascending Colon
- rich in bacteria
- fermentation
- absorption of water / ions / nutrients
- haustra increase surface area
	![gut motility-1740146619870.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/met/week%201/attachments/gut%20motility-1740146619870.webp)
## Mass Movements of the Colon
- constrictive rings occur (giant migrating contraction)
	- haustra disappear from a section of the ascending colon
		- contraction of colon distal to the disappearing haustra
			- faecal material propelled into transverse colon
				- mass movement in the transverse colon, down to the descending colon
					- once sufficient mass in rectum, defecation
						- internal (smooth) and external (skeletal) anal sphincters
## Defecation
- prevented by tone of internal sphincter and puborectalis as well as the mechanical effects of the acute anorectal angle
- initiated by puborectalis and external sphincter relaxation + increased intraabdominal pressure (squatting)
- defecation by sphincter relaxation and rectal propulsive contractions
