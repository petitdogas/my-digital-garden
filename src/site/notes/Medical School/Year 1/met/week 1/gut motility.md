# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Basic elements of control
- [ ] Movements of oesophagus, stomach & intestine during hunger and after eating
- [ ] Introduction to reflex control & feedback regulation
- [ ] The peristaltic reflex
- [ ] Different movements of the colon

# Basic Units of Control
- smooth muscle
- interstitial pacemaker cells
- enteric nervous system
- extrinsic innervation
- hormonal influences
## Interstitial Cells of Cajal (ICCs)
- depolarise spontaneously
	- allows for smooth muscle to move by itself
- connected to smooth muscle by gap junctions
## Enteric Nervous System

### Myenteric Plexus
- primary motility controller (innervates muscle)
### Submucosal Plexus
- primary fluid exchange controller (innervates vascular and epithelial layer of mucosa)
### Mucosa
- sensory and motor nerve endings
### Peristalsis

- ascending wave is excitatory (i.e. acetylcholine release)
- descending wave is inhibitory (usually via nitric oxide)
## Extrinsic Innervation of the Gut

- has sensory and motor functions
- neurotransmitter from extrinsic efferent nerve terminals can act on pacemaker cells, the enteric nervous system, and endocrine cells
## Gastrointestinal Hormones
- stomach
	- ghrelin - increases appetite
	- gastrin - secretes acid
- duodenum
	- cholecystokinin - gall bladder contraction, pancreatic exocrine secretion, GI motility
	- secretin - pancreatic exocrine secretion
	- motilin - GI motility
- pancreas
	- [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 5/homeostasis#Insulin\|insulin]] and [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 5/homeostasis#Glucagon\|glucagon]]
	- pancreatic polypeptide - gastric motility, satiation
	- amylin - glucose homeostasis, gastric motility
- colon (and small intestine)
	- GLP-1 - incretin activity, satiation
	- GLP-2 - GI motility and growth
	- oxyntomodulin - satiation, acid secretion
