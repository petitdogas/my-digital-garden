# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Describe the anatomical features and functions of the female and male genitalia and other structures comprising the pelvic viscera
- [ ] Describe the blood supply to the female and male genitalia
- [ ] Describe the relative positions of the bladder, uterus/prostate, and rectum
- [ ] Identify the anatomical features of the lower urinary tract

# Rectum
![pelvic viscera-1744376725233.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/pelvic%20viscera-1744376725233.webp)
- 2/3 of distal is retroperitoneal
- most posterior structure in pelvis
- bladder is anterior in males
- uterus is anterior in females

# Urinary Bladder
![pelvic viscera-1744376815004.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/pelvic%20viscera-1744376815004.webp)
- three openings
	- two ureteric openings
	- one urethral opening
- detrusor muscle
![pelvic viscera-1744376875232.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/pelvic%20viscera-1744376875232.webp)
- metaplasia typically found at the trigone!!
## Imaging of the Urinary Tract
- cystography - X-ray of pelvis
	- urinary catheter inserted into bladder
		- fill up with contrast dye to make things more visible and fill the space
- pyelogram/urogram - shows complete excretory system
	- can be anterograde or retrograde
	- IV contrast dye to image calices, renal pelvis, ureters, urinary bladder
## Urinary Incontinence

## Urethra
- runs from internal urethral orifice to external urethral orifice
### Male
![pelvic viscera-1744377226118.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/pelvic%20viscera-1744377226118.webp)

- segmented into three regions
	- prostatic
	- membranous
	- penile
### Female
![pelvic viscera-1744377298142.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/pelvic%20viscera-1744377298142.webp)

# Genital System
- segmented into internal and external genitalia
- functions to produce/transport gametes and secrete sex hormones
## Female
![pelvic viscera-1744377448440.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/pelvic%20viscera-1744377448440.webp)
- greater vestibular glands function to provide lubrication during sexual arousal
	- can get cysts (bottom right)
### Female Internal Genitalia
![pelvic viscera-1744377542026.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/pelvic%20viscera-1744377542026.webp)
- most anterior is bladder
- most posterior is rectum
- uterus in between
#### Uterus
- muscular organ where fertilised eggs are implanted
- highly vascular
- contracts during menstruation and innermost lining is shed
- expands a lot to fit a foetus (up to about T8/9)
	- ![pelvic viscera-1744377629688.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/pelvic%20viscera-1744377629688.webp)
##### Endometriosis
- migration of endometrial tissue outside of the uterus to elsewhere
	- typically within the female reproductive system, but not necessarily
- inflammation, scarring, presence of cysts, fibrotic lesions
- GUNPOWDER WOUNDS
	- ![pelvic viscera-1744377804857.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/pelvic%20viscera-1744377804857.webp)
- laparoscopy requried
- can be treated surgically or via pain management
#### Ovaries
- function in [[Medical School/Year 1/hd/week 1/ooegenesis, spermatogenesis, and fertilisation#Oogenesis\|oogenesis]]
- tethered to the uterus via the ovarian ligament
- exocrine - releases ovum
- endocrine - - secrete [[Medical School/Year 1/hd/week 1/reproductive endocrinology and the menstrual cycle#Oestrogens\|oestrogen]] and progesterone
#### Vagina
- elastic with soft internal lining to provide lubrication
- cervical opening superiorly
- approximately 3-6 inches in length
#### Structural Support
![pelvic viscera-1744378292655.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/pelvic%20viscera-1744378292655.webp)
- folds of the parietal peritoneum form the broad ligament
### Female External Genitalia
![pelvic viscera-1744378541836.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/pelvic%20viscera-1744378541836.webp)
- comprised of glands of the clitoris, labia majora, labia minora, opening of the vaginal canal, and mons pubis
	- referred to as the vulva
- clitoris formed from the vestibular bulb and corpus cavernosum
![pelvic viscera-1744378724922.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/pelvic%20viscera-1744378724922.webp)
## Male
### Male External Genitalia
#### Penis
![pelvic viscera-1744378926410.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/pelvic%20viscera-1744378926410.webp)
- highly vascularised
- encapsulates the urethra
- core of penis is comprised of three erectile tissue
	- two corpus cavernosum
	- one corpus spongiosum
		- this encapsulates the urethra
![pelvic viscera-1744378986388.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/pelvic%20viscera-1744378986388.webp)
#### Testis
- produce sperm and testosterone
	- therefore endocrine and exocrine
	- sperm produced within lobules and sent to the epididymis via efferent ductules
		- epididymis is a highly coiled strucure which connects to the vas deferens to transport sperm towards the prostate
- intraabdominal then descends through the inguinal canal to get outside of the pelvis
##### vas deferens
- travels from testes to the prostate
- deposits sperm into the prostatic urethra via the ejaculatory duct
##### seminal vesicles
- produce fluids which make up most of the components of semen
	- coagulation of semen, chromatin stability, suppression of female immune activity
		- deposits fluids into the prostatic urethra via the ejaculatory duct
#### Prostate
![pelvic viscera-1744379334079.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/pelvic%20viscera-1744379334079.webp)
- produces prostatic fluid to help nourish spermatozoa motility
- glandular and fibromuscular
- sits at base of the neck of the urinary bladder
##### Benign Prostate Hyperplasisa (BPH)
- typically in the transitional zone of the prostate
- enlarged, non-cancerous prostate
- influences urinary incontinence
- digital rectal exam is standard first-line investigation, then ultrasound to confirm

# Innervation
![pelvic viscera-1744379800577.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/pelvic%20viscera-1744379800577.webp)
## Sacral Plexus
- all somatic innervation to the pelvis
## Parasympathetic innervation to pelvic viscera
- pelvic splanchnic nerves (S2-S4)
## Sympathetic innervation to pelvic viscera
- sacral ganglia
- S1-S2 = sacral splanchnic nerves
- T10-L2 = thoracolumbar outflow
