# Sperm Production and Maturation
![ooegenesis, spermatogenesis, and fertilisation-1744108192977.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/ooegenesis,%20spermatogenesis,%20and%20fertilisation-1744108192977.webp)
![ooegenesis, spermatogenesis, and fertilisation-1744107614839.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/ooegenesis,%20spermatogenesis,%20and%20fertilisation-1744107614839.webp)
- mitotic divisions
	- primordial spermatocytes become spermatogonia and proliferate
- meiotic divisions of primary spermatocytes --> secondary spermatocytes
	- reduce the chromosome number and produce a cluster of haploid spermatids
- spermiogenesis
	- transformation of spermatids into mature sperm
		- ![ooegenesis, spermatogenesis, and fertilisation-1744107908134.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/ooegenesis,%20spermatogenesis,%20and%20fertilisation-1744107908134.webp)
		- loss of cytoplasm
		- development of flagellum
		- acrosome
		- mitochondria arranged around flagellum
- the entire process takes 64 days
	- as the cycle progresses, germ cells move from the basal portion of the germinal epithelium towards the lumen
## Spermatogenesis
![ooegenesis, spermatogenesis, and fertilisation-1744107277432.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/ooegenesis,%20spermatogenesis,%20and%20fertilisation-1744107277432.webp)
- at puberty, testes start producing testosterone (leydig cells)
	- triggers growth of testes
	- maturation of seminiferous tubules
	- start of spermatogenesis
	- sertoli cells differentiate
		- development of spermatids to spermatozoa
### Sertoli cells
![ooegenesis, spermatogenesis, and fertilisation-1744107466321.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/ooegenesis,%20spermatogenesis,%20and%20fertilisation-1744107466321.webp)
- support the formation and maturation of spermatozoa
- secrete a watery fluid to help transport spermatozoa through seminiferous tubules and into epididymis
- extend through the entire thickness of the germinal epithelium (from basement membrane to lumen)
- interconnected by tight junctions
	- blood-testis barrier --> selective permeability allows for rapid testosterone entry
## Capacitation
![ooegenesis, spermatogenesis, and fertilisation-1744108121736.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/ooegenesis,%20spermatogenesis,%20and%20fertilisation-1744108121736.webp)
- freshly ejaculated sperm have yet to acquire progressive motility nor fertilisation ability
- plasma membrane reorganised and made more fluid
- cholesterol degrades
- influx of Ca2+ for signalling and recognition
- physiological ROS generation
- cAMP mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation
- hyperactivated motility - reaches fallopian tube within 45 mins to 12 hours

# Oogenesis
![ooegenesis, spermatogenesis, and fertilisation-1744108351723.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/ooegenesis,%20spermatogenesis,%20and%20fertilisation-1744108351723.webp)
- oogonia enter first meiotic division in late foetal period
- prolonged resting state in prophase I stage in early months after birth
- after puberty, every monty, 15-20 primary oocytes are stimulated to complete meiosis I
	- only one is ovulated
		- per cycle, ovary loses more and more follicles
			- accelerates with age
## Metaphase II
![ooegenesis, spermatogenesis, and fertilisation-1744108699302.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/ooegenesis,%20spermatogenesis,%20and%20fertilisation-1744108699302.webp)
- secondary oocyte is arrested in metaphase II at ovulation
	- meiosis II only completed if fertilisation takes place
- first polar body produced at end of meiosis will be discarded later
- second polar body produced after fertilisation and dies
- polar bodies can be used in IVF for cytogenetic and mutational analysis

# Anovulation
- common in girls following menarche
	- ovulation missing in around half of cycles
		- five years following menarche, occurs in 75% of cycles, reaching 80% in following years
- stress, anxiety, and eating disorders can cause a fail in GnRH and disrupt the cycle
- chronic anovulation affects 6-15% of women

# Fertilisation
## Finding the Egg
- thermotaxis
	- temperature difference of 2C between storage site and fertilisation site
- rheotaxis
	- ability to align with or against fluid flow
	- positive rheotaxis is swimming against the flow
- chemotactic gradients
	- of progesterone
	- from cumulus oophorus and fMLF
## Acrosome Reaction
- zona pellucida (thick layer of ECM) binds the sperm
	- sperm binds to egg before acrosomal reaction
		- ZP3 receptor responsible for sperm - egg adhesion
		- galactosyltransferase (GalT) binds N-acetylgucosamine residues on ZP3
- binding of GalT initiates acrosome reaction
	- releases hyaluronidase to break down hyaluronic acid
- acrosin - protease
- part of sperm membrane fuses with oocyte membrane
- head of sperm sinks into oocyte
### Blocking Polyspermy
- once head of sperm sinks into oocyte
- zona pellucida releases granules to prevent multiple sperm from binding
- cortical reaction
	- granules fuse with plasma membrane, releasing enzymes
	- causes glycoprotein crosslinking and exposure of ZP2
	- makes a hard outer shell preventing any other sperm penetration
#### Fast Block
![ooegenesis, spermatogenesis, and fertilisation-1744109518359.webp|578x214](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/ooegenesis,%20spermatogenesis,%20and%20fertilisation-1744109518359.webp)
#### Slow Block
- removal of other sperm bound to plasma membrane accomplished by cortical granule reaction
- becomes active about a minute after the 1st successful sperm attaches
- cortical granules directly beneath the plasma membrane
- release proteases that clip off any other attached sperm
- release mucopolysaccharides produce osmotic gradient
	- causing water to rush into space between plasma membrane and vitelline envelope  - fertilisation envelope
- release peroxidase that hardens the fertilisation envelope 
## Oocyte Activation
- release of calcium at site of sperm penetration
	- calcium wave sweeps across egg
		- results in completion of meiosis and extrusion of polar bodies
## Completion of Meiosis II / Generation of Zygote
- oocyte completes second meiotic division and releases second polar body
- male pronucelus forms and flagella + mitochondria degenerate
- both pronuclei fuse
## Fertilised ovum undergoes cell division
- first cleavage - zygote - 24 hours after fertilisation
- series of mitotic divisions in uterine tube
	- forms smaller daughter cells called blastomeres
		- 16 blastomeres = morula
			- solid ball of cells
			- formed around day 3-4
			- has an inner and outer cell mass
- blastula / blastocyst
	- rearrangement of blastomeres to form a hollow spherical ball with an inner cavity = blastocoel
	- 128 blastomeres surround blastocoel
	- outer cell mass forms trophoblast
	- inner cell mass forms embryoblast

# Events after Fertilisation
- see [[Medical School/Year 1/hd/week 1/implantation and placental function\|implantation and placental function]]
# Blastocyst
- trophoblast have sodium pumps and exchangers that pump Na+ into centrally forming cavity
- creates osmotic drive that pulls water inside the cavity
- for implantation blastocyst needs to "hatch" from zona pellucida
