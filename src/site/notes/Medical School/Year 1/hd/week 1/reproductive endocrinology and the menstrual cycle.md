# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Understand different types of hormones involved in male and female reproductive systems and how they are synthesised
- [ ] Discuss the effect of reproductive hormones on male and female body
- [ ] Appreciate how reproductive hormones' secretion is regulated
- [ ] Explain the endocrinology and physiology of the menstrual cycle
- [ ] Outline how normal menstrual

# Hormones Involved
## Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)
- released by hypothalamus (synthesised in arcuate nucleus)
- 10 amino acids and short half-life
- synthesis and release of LH and FSH
	- hypophyseal portal vessels enables GnRH to reach anterior pituitary to do this
### Gonadotrophins
- two subunits - alpha and beta
	- alpha subunit is the same in LH, FSH, and hCG - 92 amino acids
	- beta subunit is different
		- beta subunit of LH and hCG contain the same sequence (which is why LH tests can flag up as positive in pregnant women)
			- hCG beta subunit contains an additional 24 amino acids
### Luteinising hormone (LH)
- secreted by anterior pituitary glands
- stored in gonadotrophs
### Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
- secreted by anterior pituitary glands
- stored in gonadotrophs
## Sex Steroid Hormones
- synthesised from cholesterol
- lipophilic - can simply diffuse across cell membrane
- bind to a nuclear/cytoplasmic receptor to influence gene transcription
### Oestrogens
#### Oestrone (E1)
- predominant during menopause
#### Oestradiol (E2)
- predominant in reproductive years in amount and activity
#### Oestriol (E3)
- predominant during pregnancy
#### Oestetrol (E4)
- only produced in pregnancy
### Progesterone
### Testosterone
### (Cortisol)
