- cell divisions create a mass of undifferentiated cells called morula
	- by day four, moves to the uterus
		- day five, turns into a **blastocyst**
			- outermost layer of trophoblast cells --> produce the placenta
			- innermost layer --> embryo
			- day eight, implants in the endometrium

# Implantation
![implantation and placental function-1744369709132.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/implantation%20and%20placental%20function-1744369709132.webp)
## Apposition (Day 6-7)
- positioning of the blastocyst within the uterine cavity
- trophectoderm (trophoblasts) differentiate
	- cytotrophoblasts
		- mononucleated, rapidly divide
	- syncytiotrophoblasts
		- forms from fused cytotrophoblasts
		- multinucleated, does not divide
		- fuses with pinopods
			- microvilli on syncytiotrophoblasts attach to the pinopods of the endometrium
## Adhesion (Day 7-8)
![implantation and placental function-1744370051441.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/implantation%20and%20placental%20function-1744370051441.webp)
- trophoblast cells fix to maternal tissues
	- [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 1/extracellular matrix and cell adhesion#Fibronectin and Laminin\|laminin and fibronectin]] and cell surface receptors facilitate adhesion
		- laminin for initial sticking
## Invasion (Day 8-9)
![implantation and placental function-1744370326026.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/implantation%20and%20placental%20function-1744370326026.webp)
![implantation and placental function-1744370236801.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/implantation%20and%20placental%20function-1744370236801.webp)
- blastocyst completely embedded in endometrail mucosa wall
	- blastocyst forms villi and surrounded by decidual cell layer
- beta hCG can be detected in blood and urine
- trophoblast penetrates into maternal decidua and endometrial spiral arteries
	- spiral arteries are remodelled to be larger, achieved by proteolytic enzymes

# Implantation Signalling Molecules
- cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
	- converts AA to PGE2 and promotes invasion and decidualisation
- heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF)
	- involved in attachment and invasion
- vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
	- involved in angiogenesis
- human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G)
	- inhibits antigen-specific lymphocyte response & decreases NK cell function (avoids early rejection)
## Why is the foetus not rejected by the maternal immune system?
- trophoblast cells express HLA-G
- infiltrating leukocytes secrete IL-2, which switches off CD4/CD8 cells
- decidual reaction
	- decidual cells become swollen and surround the foetus
		- forms a barrier between mother and embryo

# Placenta
## Placenta function
- provides nutrients and removes waste
	- simple diffusion of urea out
	- water, electrolytes, fatty acids simple diffusion
	- glucose via GLUTs
	- AA via active transport
	- large proteins and cells are pinocytosis (endocytosis)
- site of gas exchange and other molecules between maternal and foetal blood
	- foetal haemoglobin has more affinity and carrying capacity than adult haemoglobin
	- rate of diffusion depends on
		- maternal/foetal gas gradient
		- maternal/foetal blood flow
		- placental permeability
		- placental surface area
### Large molecules
- does not allow most large molecules (e.g. heparin and insulin)
- does allow:
	- IgG
	- hormones
	- antibiotics
	- sedatives
	- some viruses (rubella, Zika)
### Endocrine function
#### Human placental lactogen
- increases free fatty acids by lipolysis
	- ensures a sufficient nutrient supply to growing foetus
- resembles GH
- exhibits lactogenic effects - promotes mammary duct proliferation
#### Oestrogen and progesterone
- placenta produces oestrogen and progesterone
- by the end of the first trimester, placenta produces sufficient progesterone and oestrogen to no longer require the corpus luteum
#### Human placental growth hormone
- similar to GH
- regulation of maternal blood glucose levels
	- ensures adequate foetal glucose supply
- low maternal blood glucose levels = [[Medical School/Year 1/met/week 2/gluconeogenesis\|gluconeogenesis]] in maternal liver
#### Insulin-like growth factors
- stimulates proliferation and differentiation of cytotrophoblasts
#### Relaxin
- softens the cervix and pelvic ligaments in prepartion for childbirth
#### Hypothalamic and pituitary like hormones
- [[Medical School/Year 1/hd/week 1/reproductive endocrinology and the menstrual cycle#Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)\|GnRH]], cotricotrophin releasing factor
	- affect mother to produce even more
		- causes oxytocin production
## Structure of the placenta
![implantation and placental function-1744370702094.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/implantation%20and%20placental%20function-1744370702094.webp)
- shaped like a disc
- weighs about 500g
- foetal side is shiny and smooth
	- apposed amniotic membrane
- maternal side is dull and greyish
	- divided into many lobes
- remember the sides because old women are dull and grey whilst babies have smooth heads
## Placental development - chorionic villi formation
![implantation and placental function-1744370976994.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/implantation%20and%20placental%20function-1744370976994.webp)
- trophoblasts invade endometrial blood vessels, forming intertrophoblastic blood filled sinuses
- changes in spiral arteries
	- loss of elastic lamina in smooth muscle allows for greater flow of blood around the villi
- spiral arteries in contact with the placenta terminate into sinuses
	- brings blood into the intervillous space
- embryonic tissue and the maternal blood remain separated by a layer of cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts (but diffusion of nutrients is possible)
- by week three,
	- mesoderm differentiates into blood vessels that subsequently connect to vessels developing in the umbilical cord and embryo
		- forms tertiary villi
- little maternal blood until week 12/13, so hypoxic conditions enable angiogenesis
## Spiral artery remodelling
![implantation and placental function-1744371001385.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/implantation%20and%20placental%20function-1744371001385.webp)
- VSMC = vascular smooth muscle cells
- EVT = extravillous trophoblast
## The mature placenta - foetal circulation
- 2x umbilical arteries to the placenta
- smaller branches to chorionic villi
- main site of exchange are the capillary networks in terminal branches of chorionic villi
- umbilical arteries have deoxygenated blood whilst umbilical vein has oxygenated blood
## The mature placenta - maternal circulation
- 80-100 spiral arteries open directly into the intervillous spaces
- low pressure blood
- villi bathed in maternal blood (3-4 misn)
- return via venous pathways in decidual plate of placenta

# anti-D immunoglobulin
![implantation and placental function-1744372058130.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/implantation%20and%20placental%20function-1744372058130.webp)
- given at week 28 and repeated after delivery
- if mother is Rh- and baby is Rh+, she'll make antibodies against this which would harm any future Rh+ babies

# Ectopic pregnancy
![implantation and placental function-1744372121370.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/implantation%20and%20placental%20function-1744372121370.webp)
- usually in uterine tubes, but also in other non-favourable sites
- scarring or blockage in uterine tube = tubal ectopic pregnancy
- if fimbria does not work = abdominal or ovary ectopic pregnancy
- late implantation = cervical ectopic pregnancy

# Placenta praevia (low-lying placenta)
![implantation and placental function-1744372173527.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/implantation%20and%20placental%20function-1744372173527.webp)
- implantation close to cervix and placenta may cover the cervical opening
- means the baby cannot be delivered vaginally
