# Ovaries

- paired almoned-shaped organs
- cortex is the outer part and contains follicles
- medulla is inner part and is a stroma of fibroblasts, collagen, elastic fibres, blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves
- surface is simple cuboidal (and some parts are squamous)

## Primordial Follicle
![histology of the female reproductive system-1744110658877.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/histology%20of%20the%20female%20reproductive%20system-1744110658877.webp)
- surrounded by simple squamous cells
- outer layer of follicle is bounded by basal lamina
- in the stroma of the cortex beneath the tunica albuginea
## Primary Follicle
![histology of the female reproductive system-1744110711838.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/histology%20of%20the%20female%20reproductive%20system-1744110711838.webp)
- follicle cells proliferate and become simple cuboidal - unilaminar stage
	- in multilaminar stage, becomes stratified
		- follicle cells proliferate to stratified epithelium, stratum granulosum --- granulosa cells
- oocyte is larger
- secretes proteins assembled into zona pellucida - ZP3
- stromal cells form a sheath of connective tissue: theca folliculi (theca interna and theca externa)
## Secondary Follicle (Antral)
![histology of the female reproductive system-1744110906520.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/histology%20of%20the%20female%20reproductive%20system-1744110906520.webp)
- stratum granulosum of 6-12 layers --> antrum
- antrum is formed by Call-Exner bodies between granulosa cells, with follicular liquid from the blood vessels of theca interna
- granulosa cells secrete oestrogen
## Graffian Follicle
![histology of the female reproductive system-1744111114738.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/histology%20of%20the%20female%20reproductive%20system-1744111114738.webp)
- thinner stratum granulosum, increased antrum, thecal layers become more prominent
- - cumulus oophorus projects into the antrum
	- called corona radiata after ovulation
- oocyte released during ovulation, leaving behind the corpus luteum
## Corpus Luteum
![histology of the female reproductive system-1744111164893.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/histology%20of%20the%20female%20reproductive%20system-1744111164893.webp)
- collapsed follicle with remaining granulosa cells and theca cells
- - deep forms (gluteal gland)
- stromal connective tissue in the follicular cavity
- increase in size and fills with lipid droplets
## Corpus Albicans
![histology of the female reproductive system-1744111289039.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/histology%20of%20the%20female%20reproductive%20system-1744111289039.webp)

# Fallopian Tubes
![histology of the female reproductive system-1744111699158.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/histology%20of%20the%20female%20reproductive%20system-1744111699158.webp)
- walls are three layers
	- serosa - outermost layers composed of mesothelium and thin layer of connective tissue
	- muscularis - thick inner muscle layer and outer thinner muscle layer
	- mucosa - folds lined by simple columnar epithelium (ciliated and non-ciliated)
		- ciliated cells move the ovum
		- non-ciliated cels secrete fluid that provides nutrients

# Uterus
image shows proliferative, secretory phase, and ischaemic phase
![histology of the female reproductive system-1744111954817.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/histology%20of%20the%20female%20reproductive%20system-1744111954817.webp)
- endometrium: mucosa of the uterus,  proliferates and then degenerates during the  menstrual cycle. During the reproductive life  the endometrium consists of two zones:
	- stratum functionale: Thick part that is shed-off at menstruation.
	- stratum basale: Retained during menstruation  and replaces the functional layer.
- myometrium: thick muscular layer
- perimetrium: outer serous layer. Composed of mesothelium and thin layer of connective tissue

# Cervix
![histology of the female reproductive system-1744112301651.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/histology%20of%20the%20female%20reproductive%20system-1744112301651.webp)
- ectocervix is covered by stratified squamous epithelium
- transformation zone - cells change to simple columnar (endocervix)
	- zone affected during carcinogenesis (cervical screening)
- stroma consists of collagen bundles
- endocervix is lined by folded mucosa consisting of deep crypts (glands) arranged in different orientations

# Vagina
![histology of the female reproductive system-1744112552627.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/histology%20of%20the%20female%20reproductive%20system-1744112552627.webp)
- the vagina has no glands
- mucosal layer: numerous folds lined with stratified squamous non-keratinized epithelium + numerous nerve endings
- muscular layers: Outer longitudinal and inner circular.
- adventitia: Inner dense and outer loose connective tissue.

# Breast
![histology of the female reproductive system-1744112711692.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%201/attachments/histology%20of%20the%20female%20reproductive%20system-1744112711692.webp)
- mammary glands are tubuloalveolar glands derived from modified sweat glands in the epidermis
	- inactive mammary gland is composed of 15-20 irregular  lobes separated by fibrous connective tissue
- radiate from the nipple (mammary papilla) and are  subdivided into numerous lobules known as terminal duct  lobular units (TDLUs)
	- each gland ends in a lactiferous duct that opens into an opening to the nipple
