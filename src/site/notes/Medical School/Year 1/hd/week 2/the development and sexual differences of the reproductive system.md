# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Outline the development of the reproductive system
- [ ] Describe the descent of the testes and the development of the inguinal canal
- [ ] Understand the structure of the pelvic viscera in the male
- [ ] Understand the structure of female reproductive organs
- [ ] Understand the descent of the ureters through the pelvis and the position of the bladder and urethra in the male and female

# Four Parts to Sexual Development
## Genetic Sex
- chromosomal composition defined during fertilisation
## Gonadal Development

- development of testes or ovaries during embryonic development (weeks 6-7)
- gametes migrate into gonadal ridge
- mesonephros is the foetal kidney - produces urine during development
	- metanephros is the definitive kidney
### Primordial Germ Cell Migration
- week 7
- primordial germ cells (PGC) start to migrate to genital ridges
- mesothelial cells
	• seminiferous tubules
	• ovarian follicles
- mesenchymal cells
	- supporting cells (connective tissue)
## Development of Sex-Specific Internal Ducts and External Genitalia
- hormone-dependent defined during foetal development

- SRY determines Leydig Cells --> makes testosterone (can be converted to DHT)
	- supports maintenance of mesonephric duct
	- increase male stuff
- SRY determines Sertolli Cells --> Mullerian inhibitory factor (MIF)
	- decrease female stuff
### Internal Development
#### Male Development
![the development and sexual differences of the reproductive system-1745926355038.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%202/attachments/the%20development%20and%20sexual%20differences%20of%20the%20reproductive%20system-1745926355038.webp)
#### Female Development
![the development and sexual differences of the reproductive system-1745926365353.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%202/attachments/the%20development%20and%20sexual%20differences%20of%20the%20reproductive%20system-1745926365353.webp)
![the development and sexual differences of the reproductive system-1745926618669.webp|770x616](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%202/attachments/the%20development%20and%20sexual%20differences%20of%20the%20reproductive%20system-1745926618669.webp)
- Mullerian duct abnormalities could lead to having a double uterus
### External Development
- at 8 weeks foetus has:
	- Genital tubercle
	- Urogenital fold
	- Labioscrotal fold / genital swelling
- at 9 weeks sexual differentiation starts to differentiate between male and female
	- complete by 12 weeks
#### Male Development
- indifferent genitalia --> male genitalia driven by DHT (dihydrotestosterone from testes)
- rapid elongation of genital tubercle (phallus)
- urethral folds pulled to form urethral groove
	- folds close by four months to form penile urethra
- genital swellings become the scrotal swellings which move caudally forming scrotum
#### Female Development
- oestrogens are mainly responsible
- genital tubercle only elongates slightly
- urethral folds and genital swellings do not fuse
	- form labia minora and labia majora respectively
	- urogenital groove remains open
### Change in position of gonads
#### Descent of the Testes
![the development and sexual differences of the reproductive system-1745927141910.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%202/attachments/the%20development%20and%20sexual%20differences%20of%20the%20reproductive%20system-1745927141910.webp)
##### Abnormalities of testicular descent
###### Cryptorchidism
- can be unilateral or bilateral
- testes remain undescended --> reduced fertility
- typically fixes itself since it's often in premature babies who just need a bit more time to cook
- normally in inguinal canal and often descend spontaneously
- deficiency of androgen production?
###### Ectopic testes
![the development and sexual differences of the reproductive system-1745927484617.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%202/attachments/the%20development%20and%20sexual%20differences%20of%20the%20reproductive%20system-1745927484617.webp)
- very rare
- potentially multiple gubernaculum or that gubernaculum is weak or breaks 
###### Congential (Indirect) Inguinal Hernia
![the development and sexual differences of the reproductive system-1745927524174.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%202/attachments/the%20development%20and%20sexual%20differences%20of%20the%20reproductive%20system-1745927524174.webp)
#### Relocation of the Ovaries
- superior lumbar region ---> relocate to the lateral wall of the pelvis
	- processus vaginalis of the peritoneum traverses the transversalis fascia at the site of the deep inguinal ring 
		- forms inguinal canal ---> protrudes into the developing labium majorum
- postnatally, gubernaculum forms ovarian ligament and round ligament of uterus
##### Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS)
![the development and sexual differences of the reproductive system-1745927760264.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/hd/week%202/attachments/the%20development%20and%20sexual%20differences%20of%20the%20reproductive%20system-1745927760264.webp)
- have SRY ---> produce Leydig and Sertolli cells, so do lose Mullerian duct
	- therefore no uterus and no uterine tubes
	- they have testes but they don't have the androgen receptors to make them male
	- therefore they are treated as female
## Secondary Sexual Characteristics
- defined during puberty
# Sexual Conditions
## 46,XY DSD - Intersex
- mutations in SRY
	- so no testosterone and no MIF, so no maintenance of male mesonephric
- patients present as female with female external genitalia or a micropenis
	- primary amenorrhea
