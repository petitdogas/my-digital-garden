# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Describe & explain mechanics of forced inspiration and expiration
- [ ] Describe & explain ventilation disorders involving changes in: lung compliance; lung elastic recoil; alveolar surface tension; and radial traction
- [ ] Describe and explain the consequences of pleural seal being disrupted; pneumothorax
- [ ] Describe and explain lung volumes, capacities,& diffusing capacity
- [ ] Label tracing showing different lung volumes and capacities


> [!NOTE]- Ventilation Terms
anatomical dead space - volume of air in the conducting airways
alveolar dead space - air in alveoli which do not take part in gas exchange
physiological dead space = anatomical dead space + alveolar dead space
approxiately 30% of tidal volume
tidal volume = volume of air moving in/out of lungs with each respiratory cycle
total pulmonary ventilation = tidal volume x respiratory rate
alveolar ventilation = (tidal volume - air in physiological dead space) x respiratory rate

> [!NOTE]- Lung Volume Definitions
> tidal volume: amount (volume) of air moving in and out of our lungs at rest
> inspiratory reserve volume: additional amount of air which can be inhaled after normal inspiration
> expiratory reserve volume: additional amount of air which can be exhaled after normal expiration
> residual volume: amount of air that remains in the lungs after maximum forceful expiration

> [!NOTE]- Lung Capacity Definitions
> Inspiratory Capacity: total volume of air can be inspired following a normal expiration = (tidal volume + inspiratory reserve volume)
> Functional Residual Capacity: volume of air present lungs end of passive (ie not forced) expiration =  Expiratory Reserve volume + Residual Volume
> Vital Capacity: volume air exhaled after maximum inspiration - sum of inspiratory reserve volume + tidal volume + expiratory reserve volume
> Total Lung Capacity (TLC): volume of air contained lungs at end of a maximal inspiration (TLC = TV + IRV + ERV + RV)

# Forced Inspiration and Expiration
- requires involvement of more muscles
- forced inspiration
	- sternocleidomastoid, scalene muscles, serratus anterior, pectoralis major
- forced expiration
	- internal intercostals, abdominal wall muscles

# Types of airflow obstruction

# Lung disorders related to impaired ventilation
- [[Medical School/Year 1/cr/week 3/respiratory system physiology#Pneumothorax\|pneumothorax]] - air in the intrapleural space with loss of pleural seal
- [[Medical School/Year 1/cr/week 3/respiratory system physiology#Interstitial Lung Disease\|interstitial lung disease]] - increased collagen in alveolar walls - decreased compliance
- obstructive lung disease (COPD, asthma)
- hypoventilation - inability to expand chest and ventilate alveoli
- respiratory distress syndrome new born - decreased surfactant
## Pneumothorax
- tear in parietal or visceral pleura
	- air flows into the pleural cavity
		- due to pressure gradient
			- pleural seal is lost
				- lung elastic recoil not [[Medical School/Year 1/cr/week 2/introduction to respiratory system immunity and physiology#Inward Pull of the Lung Results in a Negative Pressure Between Pleura\|counterbalanced by chest wall]]
					- lung collapses
![respiratory system physiology-20241217114323035.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/cr/week%203/attachments/respiratory%20system%20physiology-20241217114323035.webp)
### Signs
- tachycardia
- tachypnoea
- hypotension (if tension pneumothorax)
- hyper-resonance to percussion over affected lung
- absent or decreased breath sounds over lung
### Symptoms
- dyspnoea
- pleuritic chest pain (sharp, well localised, worse with inspiration)
- cough
- fatigue
## Interstitial Lung Disease
- thickening of the pulmonary interstitium
	- ![respiratory system physiology-20241217114907864.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/cr/week%203/attachments/respiratory%20system%20physiology-20241217114907864.webp)
- lung compliance is reduced - lungs are stiff and harder to expand
- elastic recoil of the lungs is increased - lungs return to original size more quickly
- resting lung volume is smaller than normal
- categorised as a restrictive lung disease
### Signs
- decreased lung excursion on palpation
- bi-basal end inspiratory lung crackles
- finger clubbing
- small pleural effusions
### Symptoms
- dry cough
- dyspnoea on exertion
- fatigue
- gradual, insidious progression
## Hypoventilation
- low respiratory rate or low tidal volume for adequate gas exchange
- lots of causes
	- damage to brain stem
		- head injury, opiates
	- spinal cord trauma
	- Guillaine-Barre syndrome
	- mysathenia gravis
	- inherited muscle diseases (Duchenne muscular dystrophy)
	- severe obesity kyphoscoliosis
	- pneumothorax, large pleural effusions
	- respiratory disease of newborn
	- lung fibrosis
	- laryngeal oedema
## Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (NRDS)
- surfactant production issue
	- lung expansion at birth is incomplete
		- stiff lungs - decreased compliance, increased recoil
### Signs
- grunting
- nasal flaring,
- intercostal and subcostal retractions
- rapid respiratory rate (tachypnoea)
- cyanosis
