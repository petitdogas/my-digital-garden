# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Describe structure of haemoglobin and why it is suitable for carriage of oxygen
- [ ] Explain significance of subunit structure of haemoglobin and oxygen binding
- [ ] Describe significance of methaemoglobin in erythrocytes.
- [ ] Interpret fully labelled diagram of oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve.
- [ ] Explain how the oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve shifts under influence of temperature, pH and 2,3 DPG levels.
- [ ] Explain term haematocrit and how it is regulated.
- [ ] Describe ways and forms in which carbon dioxide is transported by blood

# Carbon Dioxide
- 10% dissolved in blood
- 60% in bicarbonate
- 30% in haemoglobin

- most RBC bicarbonate formed expelled into plasma and carried in venous blood to  lungs.
- as bicarbonate diffuses out, chloride ions diffuse into RBC
	- to maintain electrical neutrality
		- chloride shift
# Reticulocytes
- immature red blood cells
- 1-2% of the circulating red blood cells in healthy people
- carry oxygen, just not as efficiently
- reticular network of ribosomal RNA visible with methylene blue stain
	- to complete production of haemoglobin

# Red Blood Cell Metabolism + Lifespan
- produce ATP by anaerobic glycolysis
	- pyruvate to lactic acid
- glucose uptake mediated by Glut1 transporters
	- facilitated diffusion (not regulated by insulin)
## RBC Anti-Oxidants
- NADPH generated from pentose phosphate pathway
	- required for glutathione reductase
		- glutathione is a key anti-oxidant
- RBCs also have Vitamin C
### How do we regenerate NADPH?
- glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
- glutathione reductase NADPH
	- in RBCs, G6PD is the key enzyme
#### G6PD Deficiency and Associated Pathology
- glutathione remains oxidised, leaving RBCs vulnerable to oxidative stress
- haemolysis - haemolytic anaemia
- patients may present with jaundice, dark urine, pallor, fatigue, shortness of breath
- triggered by ingestion of fava beans, infections, primaquine, dapsone, -sulfonamides

# Haem
- porphyrin ring with iron in the middle
	- myoglobin, cytochromes, catalases, heme peroxidase, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase
- histidine group underneath the ring binds to one iron electron
	- oxygen forms a weak bond with the other electron
		- changes structure of haemoglobin molecules
			- cooperative binding
- at low partial pressures of O<sub>2</sub>, first oxygen leaves the haemoglobin
	- makes it harder for the remaining oxygens to stay on, so they leave too
## Cooperativity
- decreased steric hindrance as more O2 bound to haemoglobin (occurs in high pO2 environment - lungs); more steric hindrance as less O2 bound to haemoglobin (occurs in low pO2 environment – tissues).
## Methaemoglobin
- iron is oxidised to Fe<sup>3+</sup> which can't carry oxygen
	- methaemoglobin reductase is an NADPH-dependent enzyme which will reduce this back to Fe<sup>2+</sup> 
		- but RBCs don't have a nucleus, so this enzyme is limited in cells
			- some people may therefore get methaemoglobinaemia
## RBC Damage & Destruction
- RBC senescence can be signalled by levels of methaemologin
	- detected by liver and spleen, which then destroy the RBCs and recycle the iron
# Oxygen/Hb Dissociation Curve

## Bohr Effect - Acidic pH
- curve shifted to right, so O<sub>2</sub> unloading in tissues
	- lower pH in metabolically active tissues
## Temperature - highre temperature
- curve shifted to right
	- higher temperature in metabolically active tissues
## 2,3,-DPG effect
- 2,3-DPG intermediate of RBC glycolysis is normally rapidly consumed
	- in hypoxaemia, RBC production of 2,3-DPG increases
		- shifts curve to right
			- facilitates unloading in tissues

# Myoglobin
- Mb is a form of Hb found in muscles
- single subunit protein with a higher affinity for oxygen
	- O2 is transferred to MbO2 from Hb as blood passes through muscle capillaries
		- especially important start of exercise
- myoglobin is not normally found in smooth muscle
![carriage of oxygen and carbon dioxide in blood-20241218115609065.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/cr/week%203/attachments/carriage%20of%20oxygen%20and%20carbon%20dioxide%20in%20blood-20241218115609065.webp)
- myoglobin slowly beomes oxidised to metmyoglobin (Fe<sup>3+</sup>)
	- metmyoglobin reductase enzymes in muscle reduce it back to myoglobin
- more myoglobin allows you to hold your breath for longer

# Erythropoetin
- hormone Epo - from the kidneys
- in response to hypoxia, kidney renal cortex interstitial peritubular cells produce Epo
	- depends on Hb concentration, arterial pO2, Hb-O2 affinity, blood circulation
- concentration of circulating Epo increases exponentially with decreasing Hb concentration in uncomplicated anaemia
