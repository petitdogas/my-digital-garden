# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Describe and explain the role of the brainstem in control ventilation including the organisation & function of respiratory centre
- [ ] Describe and explain sensors and effectors in neural & chemical control of ventilation
- [ ] Describe and explain the CO2-HCO3 buffer system in context of chemical control breathing and pH homeostasis
- [ ] Describe and explain location, function, enervation and differences of the peripheral and central chemoreceptors (sensors)
- [ ] Interpret graphs showing how alterations in Pa02 and PaCO2 alter ventilation

# Major Groups of Neurones
## Dorsal Respiratory Group
- basic respiratory rhythm set by central pattern generator in VRG (rostral region) pre-Bötzinger complex: sends pacemaker signals to DRG
- DRG premotor neurons project to groups of spinal motor neurons
	- phrenic nerve (diaphragm) and intercostal nerves (external intercostals)
- receives information from various sensors via cranial nerves X and IX, including chemoreceptors, lung and chest wall mechanoreceptors
## Ventral Respiratory Group
- primarily coordinate accessory muscles inspiration and expiration
- highly active during exercise and any forced ventilatory manoeuvres
	- people with lung disease
- VRG premotor neurons control the internal intercostals and other accessory muscles of expiration
## Pontine Respiratory Centre (Apneustic Centre and Pneumotaxic Centre)
- limit lung expansion
- faster transition from inspiration to expiration - shorter inspiratory phase leads to increased breathing rate

# Chemical Control of Ventilation
- peripheral chemoreceptors sense PO<sub>2</sub>, PCO<sub>2</sub> and pH
- central chemoreceptors sense pCO<sub>2</sub> (primary stimulus) and pH
- these then report to the DRG
## Peripheral Chemoreceptors
- carotid bodies - CN IX
	- located at the bifurcation of the common carotid arteries
	- supplied by parasympathetic and sympathetic efferent nerve fibres in glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves
		- constriction/dilation of the capillaries
- aortic bodies - CN X
	- located in aortic arch
- both bodies are sensitive to decreases in arterial PO<sub>2</sub>
	- also stimulated by hypercapina and acidosis (but not main function)
	- major function is sensing hypoxaemia and signalling cells in medulla to icnrease alveolar ventilation
### pH
- increase firing in acidosis causing increased ventilation
	- to lower CO<sub>2</sub>, so carbonic acid would dissociate to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O
## Central Chemoreceptors
- located on the brain side of the BBB
	- in ventral medulla
- senses increases in arterial PCO<sub>2</sub>
- carbon dioxide diffuses freely through blood brain barrier into CSF
	- reacts with water to form carbonic acid
		- carbonic acid is converted into protons and bicarbonate by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase
			- central chemoreceptors detect pH change
- choroid plexus in CSF reabsorbs (active transport) and synthesises bicarbonate to adjust pH

# Other lung receptors affecting ventilation (mechano & chemical)
## Pulmonary Stretch Receptors
- in bronchioles and small bronchi
- inhibit inspiration when lungs become fully inflated
	- prevents damage to lungs from overinflation
- impulses sent to afferents of vagus nerve to prevent further inspiration
	- Hering-Breuer inflation reflex
## Irritant receptors
- mechanoreceptors found in lining of trachea and large bronchi
- detect objects in airways too large to be carried away by mucus; they activate cough reflexes
## J-receptors
- chemoreceptors respond to pulmonary edema, pulmonary emboli, pneumonia, and barotrauma – pathophysiological processes that decrease oxygenation
- stimulate an increase in ventilation

# Summary
- normoxic conditions - central used
- hypoxic conditions - peripheral used
