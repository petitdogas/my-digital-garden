# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Recognise the histological features in the heart (such as cardiac muscle, valves, cardiac skeleton) that allow it to serve as a pump
- [ ] Be able to describe the histological features of the conduction system from the sinoatrial node to the ventricle, and recognise the cells in the ventricle that are involved
- [ ] Distinguish the different blood vessels at the light and electron microscope levels, taking note of the diameter of the vessel lumen in relation to vessel wall thickness.
- [ ] Describe the major histological features of blood vessels of different diameters, including the predominant wall-forming layer and the functional importance of this layer
- [ ] Understand the structural variations in capillary endothelium and their implications for capillary permeability

# Overview
- Cardiac muscle: responsible for contraction
- Fibrous skeleton
	- four fibrous rings surrounding the valves
	- 2 fibrous triangular structures connecting the rings and membranous parts of the two septa
- Conducting system: formed by modified muscle cells (Purkinje fibres)
	- responsible for initiation and propagation of rhythmic contractions.
- Coronary vasculature
	- two coronary arteries and coronary veins.
# Heart Layers
## Epicardium
- visceral layer of serous pericardium
- single layer of mesothelial cells
	- underlying layer of connective and adipose tissue
- blood vessels and nerves to heart in this layer
## Myocardium
- consists of cardiac muscle
	- thicker in ventricles
- layer of interconnected myocytes with associated vessels
- intercalated discs seen as dense eosinophilic lines
	- contian desmosomes, fascia adherens, and gap junctions
## Endocardium
- inner layer of endothelium
- subendothelial connective tissue
	- dense connective tissue in left atrium and subvalvular parts of ventricles
- middle layer of connective tissue and smooth muscle cells
- deeper layer of connective tissue (subendocardial layer)

# Valves
- connective tissue with overlying endocardium
	- fibrosa
		- forms the core of the valve-DIC
	- spongiosa
		- loose connective tissue on atrial side
			- shock absorber
	- ventricularis
		- adjacted to ventricular suface of valve
		- dense connective tissue with elastic fibres
		- forms the chordae tendineae

# Cardiac Conducting System
- SA and AV nodes are modified myoocytes
	- ![cardiovascular histology-20241126122528396.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/cr/week%201/attachments/cardiovascular%20histology-20241126122528396.png)

# Arteries and Veins
## Layers
### tunica intima
- innermost
- consists of endothelium, basal lamina, and subendothelial layer (loose connective tissue)
#### endothelium
- maintenance of selective permeability barrier
	- non-thrombogenic barrier-anticoagulants
- modulates blood flow
- regulation of the immune system
- hormonal synthesis and modification of lipoproteins
### tunica media
- middle layer
- consists of circular arrangements of smooth muscle cells layers
### tunica adventitia
- outermost layer
- connective tissue, collagen, few elastic fibres

## Arteries
- large arteries / elastic arteries - aorta and pulmonary arteries
- medium arteries / muscular arteries - difficult to distinguish from large
- small arteries and arterioles - can be distinguished from the layers of smooth muscle cells in the tunica media
![cardiovascular histology-20241126123815686.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/cr/week%201/attachments/cardiovascular%20histology-20241126123815686.png)
### Large Arteries (elastic)
- tunica intima is thick and consists of endothelium, subendothelial connective tissue, and an internal elastic membrane
- tunica media is thickest
	- multiple layers of smooth muscle cells separated by elastic lamellae
		- synthesise [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 1/extracellular matrix and cell adhesion\|ECM]]
	- no fibroblasts
- tunica adventitia is relatively thin
	- collagen and elastic fibres, fibroblasts, macrophages, blood vessels and nerves

### Medium Arteries (muscular)
- tunica intima is thinner with a prominent, fenestrated internal elastic membrane
- tunica media composed entirely of smooth muscle cells with little elastic material
- tunica adventitia is relatively thick and often separated from the tunica media by a recognisable external elastic membrane
![cardiovascular histology-20241126123748690.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/cr/week%201/attachments/cardiovascular%20histology-20241126123748690.png)

## Small Arteries and Arterioles
- arterioles have 1-2 layers of smooth muscle cells in their tunica media
- arterioles control the blood flow to the capillaries by the contraction of smooth muscle cells

## Capillaries
- smallest diameter - single layer of endothelial cells and basal lamina
- allow gas and metabolite exchange between cells and blood stream
- pericytes replace any damaged endothelial cells

### Types of Capillaries

## Veins
- large veins - superior and inferior vena cava and hepatic portal vein
- medium veins
- small veins
- venules
### Large Veins
- tunica intima is relatively thin; boundaries with tunica media are not often clear

	- contains longitudinally disposed smooth muscle cells
- contains valves
### Medium Veins
- tunica intima consists of the endothelium, basal lamina, thin subendothelial layer with occasional smooth muscle cells
- tunica media is thin with collagen and elastic fibres
- tunica adventitia is thickest layer with collagen and elastic fibres
### Venules
#### Postcapillary venules
- collect blood from the  capillary network
- pericytes (contractible cells wrapped around the endothelial cells)
- made up of endothelial, basal lamina and pericytes
#### Muscular venules
- can be distinguished by the presence of tunica media
- distal to the postcapillary venules
- 1-2 smooth muscle cell layers

# Lymphatic Vessels
- unidirectional
- carry excess interstitial fluid from tissues to blood
- smallest are lymphatic capillaries (converge into larger lymphatic vessels)
	- more permeable than blood capillaries
	- tubes of endothelium with lack of continual basal lamina
	- numerous in loose connective membrane
