# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Describe how the sequential pattern of contraction and relaxation in the heart results in a normal pattern of blood flow
- [ ] Understand the pressure, volume, and flow changes that occur during the cardiac cycle
- [ ] Understand and calculate indices of cardiac performance such as stroke volume, cardiac output and Ejection Fraction (EF)
- [ ] Explain how preload, afterload and contractility determine cardiac performance
- [ ] Understand how the first and second heart sounds (S1 and S2) are generated and understand the basis of additional heart sounds (S3 and S4)

# Phases of the Cardiac Cycle
## Phase 1 - Atrial Systole
- ECG - atrial depolarisation - P wave
- contraction of atria leads to higher pressure
- ventricular filling thanks to atrial kick
	- AV valves open, so blood flows into ventricles (10-20%)
		- ventricles now have 120ml - **end-diastolic volume (EDV)**
			- increased ventricular pressure, so AV valves close
				- first heart sound S1
## Phase 2 - Ventricular Isovolumic Contraction
- ECG - QRS complex
- ventricles contract but no shortening of muscles
- ventricular pressure increases, but volume remains constant
	- all valves are closed and AV valve bulges into atrium
		- atrial C wave
		- **no ejection of blood**
## Phase 3 - Ventricular Ejection
- ECG - ST segment - T wave
- ventricular isotonic contraction
	- ventricular pressure increases above aortic/PA pressure
		- aortic/pulmonary valves open, allowing blood ejection through
			- ~70ml of blood - **stroke volume**
				- ~50ml is left behind - **end systolic volume (ESV)**
			- atrial pressure falls - x descent
			- aortic/PA pressure rises
- rapid ejection
- slow ejection
## Phase 4 - Ventricular Isovolumic Relaxation
- ECG - after end of T wave
- pressure within ventricles is less than pressure in the aorta/PA
	- valves closed
		- ventricles relax with no change in volume
			- atria fill with blood, increasing atrial pressure - V wave
## Phase 5 - Ventricular Filling
- ECG - between end of T and start of P
- ventricular pressure decreases below atrial pressure
	- fall in ventricular pressure --> Y descent
	- AV valves open
		- aortic/pulmonary valves closed
			- ventricles fill to 80% capacity
- rapid filling
	- blood in atria (accumulated in diastole) fills ventricles
- slow filling
	- blood from vena cavae fills ventricles
### factors affecting ventricular filling
- the filling pressure of blood returning to the heart and atria,
- the ability of the AV valves to open fully (not be stenotic)
- the ability of the ventricular wall to expand passively with little resistance (i.e., to
have high compliance)

# Pressure Volume Loop

- left ventricular pressure plotted against left ventricular volume at multiple points in time during the same cardiac cycle
## Indicies of Cardiac Performance
### Stroke Volume
- volume of blood ejected by each ventricular contraction into the aorta/PA per cardiac cycle
- SV = EDV - ESV
### Cardiac Output
- volume of blood pumped out by each ventricle per minute
- CO = SV x heart rate (bpm)
### Ejection Fraction
- fraction of the EDV that is ejected into the aorta/PA
- EF = EDV/ESV x 100

# Factors which determine Cardiac Performance
## Preload
- tension on the ventricular muscle when it begins to contract at the end of diastole
- change in sarcomere length (stretch of myocardium)
- too much preload and crossbridges cannot form
- too little preload and no room for contraction
- index is EDV
## Afterload
- the load that the heart must eject blood against
- marker is aortic pressure / systemic vascular resistance
- LV afterload can be defined as the tension / stress developed in the LV wall during ejection
	- LV afterload is determined by arterial pressure and volume and thickness of the LV
## Contractility / Ionotropy
- how efficiently the myocardium contracts from a given muscle length
- can be altered by [[Medical School/Year 1/cr/week 1/introduction to cardiac physiology#Regulation by the ANS\|mechanisms that affect Ca2+ handling]] by myocytes
- index is the ejection fraction
