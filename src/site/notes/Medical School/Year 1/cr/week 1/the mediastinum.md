# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Identify the divisions of the mediastinum
- [ ] Describe the organisation of the structures in the superior mediastinum
- [ ] Describe the organisation of the structures in the inferior mediastinum and its three sub-divisions (anterior, middle and posterior)
- [ ] Describe the arrangement of the pericardium
- [ ] Describe the arterial supply and the venous drainage of the thoracic wall

# Transthoracic Plane
- have to use bones to landmark because everything else moves depending on posture and inspiration/expiration
- runs from manubriosternal joint (sternal angle)
	- intervertebral disc T4/5 separates superior and inferior mediastinum

# Position of Structures
## Supine
- arch of aorta superior to transthoracic plane
- bifurcation of trachea transected by transthoracic plane
- central tendon lies at level of xiphisternal junction and T9
## Standing
- everything a few centimetres below when supine because gravity
- arch of aorta transected by transthoracic plane
- trachial birfucation inferior to transthoracic plane
- central tendon to middle of xiphoid process T9/T10

# Main Contents of Mediastinum

## Superior
- brachiocephalic veins and superior vena cava
- aortic arch
	- brachiocephalic trunk
		- right subclavian artery
		- right vertebral artery
		- right internal thoracic artery
		- right thyrocervical trunk
		- right common carotid artery
	- left common carotid artery
	- left subclavian artery
		- left vertebral artery
		- left internal thoracic artery
		- left thyrocervical trunk
- trachea C6-T4
- oesophagus
	- C6-T10
		- 10 letters goes through the diaphragm so T10
- thymus gland
- right lymphatic duct and superior lymphatic trunks
- phrenic nerves
	- C3, 4, and 5 will keep your diaphragm alive!
		- sensory to pericardium and mediastinal pleura
- vagus nerve and recurrent laryngeal nerves
	- vagus is cranial nerve X
	- parasympathetic
	- oesophagus, heart, bronchi
## Inferior
### anterior
- thymus
### middle
- pericardium and heart
	- midclavicular line down to fifth intercostal space you find your apex beat and can auscultate for the mitral valve
### posterior
mnemonic for contents
- Descending aorta
- Azygous veins and hemiazygous vein
- Thoracic duct
- Esophagus (oesophagus)
- Sympathetic trunk

# Blood Supply to Thoracic Wall
## Arterial supply to posterior
- posterior intercostal arteries are branches of the descending aorta
	- except for 1 and 2 which come from the costocervical trunk off the subclavian

## Arterial supply to anterior
- from internal thoracic arteries which run deep to costal cartilages
- internal thoracic artery from subclavian arteries
- anastomosis with posterior intercostal arteries in each space

## in general
- each intercostal space contains (VAN) that runs in upper part of each intercostal space
	- 1 large posterior intercostal artery from descending aorta except 1 and 2
	- 2 small anterior intercostal arteries - one main and one small collateral
	- anastomose for complete blood supply all the way around

# Thoracic venous drainage - azygos system
## anterior intercostal veins
- internal thoracic vein
## posterior intercostal veins
- azygos vein - right
	- drainage into inferior vena cava
- hemiazygos vein - left
