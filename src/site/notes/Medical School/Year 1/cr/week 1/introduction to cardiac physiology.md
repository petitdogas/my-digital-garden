# Learning Obejctives
- [ ] Describe and explain the electrophysiology of the cardiac muscle, Excitation-Contraction coupling, and heartbeat generation
- [ ] Describe and understand the components of electrical conduction pathways
- [ ] Name components of the conduction pathway

# Characteristics of Cardiomyocytes
- branched, striated, centrally-located nuclei
- excitable cells - membranes can be de/repolarised
- communication between cells at intercalated discs

## Sarcomere

- Z-lines - actin attachment site, lateral boundaries sarcomeres
- M-line - myosin attachment site
- A-band - actin and myosin overlap
- H-band - myosin alone
- I-band - actin alone

## Intercalated Discs
- thickening of the sarcolemma where cells are joined together
- gap junctions - connexins form channels enabling ions (AP) to spread from cell to cell throughout atria and ventricles
- desmosomes - intermediate filaments between cardiomyocytes to prevent separation
- fascia adherens - sites of actin filaments binding between sarcomeres

# Cardiac Conduction System
- cardiomyocytes act as a syncytium 
	- one functional unit, allowing for synchronous contraction/relaxation
- pacemaker cells exhibit automaticity
	- they generate their own action potential
- pacemaker cells exhibit rhythmicity
	- generate APs in a regular and repetitive manner

## Sinoatrial Node
- positioned on the wall of the right atrium, near the superior vena cava
- modified cardiac muscle cells
- connected to adjacent atrial cells by gap junctions
### SAN pacemaker cells AP (4-0-3)
- automaticity
- 4: opening of HCN channels when membrane potential is less than -50mV
	- Na+ enters cell, causing depolarisation
- 0: threshold potential reached, causing voltage-gated Ca2+ channels to open
	- further depolarisation
- 3: Ca2+ channels close, K+ channels open
	- cell repolarises, K+ channels close
		- back to -50mV
## Atrioventricular Node
- located in the septum, near the tricuspid valve
- after 60ms, depolarisation from SAN reaches AVN
	- transmission of AP in ventricles 60ms later (cum. 120ms)
		- via Bundle of His, down the left and right bundle branches
			- towards Purkinje fibres
### AVN cells AP (0-1-2-3-4)
![introduction to cardiac physiology-20241126145053816.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/cr/week%201/attachments/introduction%20to%20cardiac%20physiology-20241126145053816.png)
- 0: neighbouring cell AP causes depolarisation of cell
	- threshold reached, voltage-gated Na+ channels open
		- influx of Na+ - depolarisation
- 1: initial repolarisation - Na+ channels close and voltage-gated K+ channels open
	- efflux of K+
- 2: L voltage-gated Ca2+ channels open, causing a plateau
	- K+ efflux continues
		- cell depolarised and repolarised at the same time
			- **Effective Refractory Period (ERP)**
				- allows Ca2+ to bind to troponin, preventing premature muscle contraction and keeps all cells synchronous
				- this is what a defibrillator causes
- 3: rapid repolarisation - voltage gated Ca2+ channels close and slow voltage gated K+ channels open
	- more K+ efflux
- 4: resting potential - high K+ permeability
## Cardiac Excitation Contraction Coupling (E-C coupling)
![introduction to cardiac physiology-20241126150209551.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/cr/week%201/attachments/introduction%20to%20cardiac%20physiology-20241126150209551.png)
## Contraction Mechanism
![introduction to cardiac physiology-20241126150438302.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/cr/week%201/attachments/introduction%20to%20cardiac%20physiology-20241126150438302.png)
![introduction to cardiac physiology-20241126150453086.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/cr/week%201/attachments/introduction%20to%20cardiac%20physiology-20241126150453086.png)
# Regulation by the ANS
## Parasympathetic Chronotropy
- SAN innervated by vagal and sympathetic autonomic nerve fibres
- parasympathetic nerves from vagus
	- release Ach --> muscarinic receptors
		- K+ channels open --> efflux of K+
			- decreases depolarisation rate
				- decreases AP rate
					- heart slows down (negative chronotropic effect)
## Sympathetic Chronotropy
![introduction to cardiac physiology-20241126144403586.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/cr/week%201/attachments/introduction%20to%20cardiac%20physiology-20241126144403586.png)
- noradrenaline acts on β1 adrenoreceptors
	- increases Ca2+ influx
		- speeds up depolarisation in pacemaker cells
			- increases AP rate
				- heart speeds up (positive chronotropic effect)
## Parasympathetic Ionotropy
- parasympathetic nerves (vagal efferents) have little effect or negative ionotropic effect
## Sympathetic Ionotropy
- mediated by β1 adrenoreceptor responding to noradrenaline
	- increasing Ca2+ influx via LTCC (during phase 2/plateau phase) and increasing sarcoplasmic Ca2+ release
		- increased contractile force in atria/ventricles (positive ionotropic effect)
