# Arteries
## Elastic/Conducting Artery
- large tunica media
- large amount of Elastin
- own blood supply vasa vasorum
- aorta, common iliac, subclavian
## Muscular/Distributing Artery
- large tunica media with IEL and EEL
- large amount of Smooth muscle
- renal artery, brachial, femoral
## Arteriole/Resistance artery
- narrow lumen-hence resists amount of blood to an organ
