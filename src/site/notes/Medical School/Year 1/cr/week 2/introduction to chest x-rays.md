# Learning Objectives
- [ ] To understand the basic concepts of CXR
- [ ] To be able to identify key landmarks on CXR
- [ ] To introduce CXR interpretation
- [ ] Brief introduction into pathologies

# Key Landmarks

# RIPE
## Rotation
- check for spinous processes being equidistant from the clavicles
## Inspiration
- count anterior ribs from midclavicular line down to diaphragm
	- 5-7 ribs normal
	- less than 5 is insufficient inspiration
	- more than 7 is hyperinflation
## Penetration
- is the spine visible?
- winking owl sign

## Positioning
- AP or PA?
- position of scapula
	- scapula is out of the way in PA, but shadows ribs in AP
- heart size
	- heart looks bigger in AP
## Exposure
- able to see below diaphragm?
- able to see both humeral heads?
- left hemidiaphragm visible to spine?
- vertebrae visible behind heart?

# Systemic Approach to CXR
## A - Airway
- check for trachea
	- is it central? has it been pushed/pulled?

## B - Breathing
- trace the outline of the lung
- check for lung markings extending all the way out
- look for abnormal opacification or radiolucent areas (dense white or dark areas)
- look at costophrenic angles for fluid levels (meniscus)
- does lung look hazy? fluffy?
- more prominent lung markings?
## C - Circulation
- heart to diaphragm ratio
	- more than 50% is abnormal
- aortic knuckle/arch size?
- widened mediastinum?
- are heart contours clear?
## D - Diaphragm
- dome-shaped?
- right higher than left?
- check costiophrenic and cardiophrenic angles
- look for air under diaphragm
## E - Everything Else
- check bones!!
	- clavicle, ribs, humeral head/proximal shaft
- foreign objects
	- drains, pacemaker, wires
