# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Understand the anatomy of the microcirculation
- [ ] Describe the three types of capillaries with reference to their structure, distribution and function:
	- Continuous
	- Fenestrated
	- Discontinuous
- [ ] Describe how different substances can move across the capillary endothelium.
- [ ] Explain filtration and reabsorption of fluid along an average capillary
- [ ] Explain how capillary hydrostatic pressure, interstitial hydrostatic pressure, plasma oncotic pressure and interstitial oncotic pressure can affect fluid movements between plasma, interstitial space and lymph - Starling principle
- [ ] Describe the different causes of oedema and explain the pathophysiology of each

# Microcirculation
- network of arterioles, capillaries, and venules
- certain organs have arteriovenous anastomoses
	- enable increased or decreased blood flow as necessary
## Function
- deliver nutrients
- gas exchange
- removal of waste products
- cellular communication
- fluid balance between vascular and cellular compartments
### blood pressure
- arterioles are major resistance vessels determining Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR)
### cardiac output
- CO = SV x HR
- venules are capacitance vessels
	- hold majority of blood volume
		- affect [[Medical School/Year 1/cr/week 1/heart as a pump#Preload\|preload]]
			- affects stroke volume
### immune function
- coordinates localised blood flow to inflammation
- changes permeability to permit migration of leukocytes
### thermoregulation
- arteriovenous anastomoses present in skin
	- open sphincters increase heat loss
	- closed sphincters decrease heat loss

# Capillaries
## Types of Capillaries
![microcirculation and oedema-20241213111221329.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/cr/week%202/attachments/microcirculation%20and%20oedema-20241213111221329.webp)
- basement membrane
	- underlies endothelial cells (ECs) providing structural support AND part of the filtration system
- endothelial cells (ECs)
	- single layer ECs held together by tight junctions
- no smooth muscle
### Continuous Capillaries
- least permeable capillaries
	- sealed endothelium and tight junctions
- only permeable to small molecules like O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>
- widely distributed
	- lungs, skeletal muscle, skin
	- brain (BBB)
### Fenestrated Capillaries
- middle permeable capillaries
- small fenestrations in endothelial cells
	- allows free passage of salts, glucose and water from plasma to tissues
- distributed in bulk transport tissues
	- kidneys, pancreas, GI tract
### Sinusoidal/Discontinuous Capillaries
- most permeable capillaries
	- wider than other capillaries and wide spaces between endothelial cells
		- and incomplete basement membrane
- allows RBCs, WBCs, and large proteins to pass through
- found in spleen, liver, bone marrow
## Mechanisms of Transport of Molecules

### Caveolae
- invaginations of the endothelial cell membrane
	- forms flask-shaped pits in parts of the membrane
		- pits lined with lipid-binding proteins
			- detach from plasma membrane and move through cytosol
				- transcytosis
					- transports substances such as lipids, albumin (in liver)

### Bulk flow - water
- in brain, continuous capillaries (BBB) have limited flow of water
	- due to tight junctions that prevent paracellular transport.
	- water moves via transcellular pathways
		- through aquaporins
			- in response to osmotic gradients between between  intracellular space, interstitial space, and blood vessels
- in other continuous capillaries (muscles, skin), there is bulk flow of water
	- fenestrated capillaries also support bulk flow of water as well as with larger molecules

- oncotic pressure – osmotic pressure exerted by proteins, aka colloidal osmotic pressure

> [!faq]+ net filtration
> net filtration ≈ ​(P<sub>c</sub>​−P<sub>i</sub>​)−(π<sub>c</sub>​−π<sub>i</sub>​)
> where π is oncotic pressure and P is hydrostatic pressure
> c in capillaries, i in interstitial fluid

### Diffusion
![microcirculation and oedema-20241213113727157.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/cr/week%202/attachments/microcirculation%20and%20oedema-20241213113727157.webp)
- (P<sub>1</sub> - P<sub>2</sub>): partial pressure difference (gradient) across membrane
- A: the surface area available for diffusion
- T: (thickness) i.e. distance molecules must diffuse
- D: diffusion coefficient of individual gas that depends on solubility and √molecular weight

# Lymphatic System
## Lymphatic Vessels
- specialised vessels made up of an endothelium with large intercellular gaps surrounded by permeable basement membrane
- end as blind sacs within tissues
- contain one-way valves that ensure lymph travels away from tissues
- fluid enters lymph capillaries driven by higher interstitial hydrostatic pressure

# Oedema
- abnormal accumulation of fluid in interstitial spaces due to
	- imbalance in hydrostatic and oncotic pressures
	- increased capillary permeability
	- impaired lymphatic drainage
## increased capillary hydrostatic pressure
- deep venous thromboembolism
![microcirculation and oedema-20241213114318296.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/cr/week%202/attachments/microcirculation%20and%20oedema-20241213114318296.webp)
- lower extremity pitting oedema from biventricular heart failure
![microcirculation and oedema-20241213114344036.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/cr/week%202/attachments/microcirculation%20and%20oedema-20241213114344036.webp)
- pregnancy especially in final trimester may cause lower extremity oooedema from increased HP
## decreased plasma oncotic pressure
- nephrotic syndrome, liver disease (synthesises albumin), malnutrition (severe)
- nephrotic syndrome – lose albumin through kidney.
	- increased oedema in tissues diffusely but prominent around eyes -  loose connective tissue - especially in children (adults less elastic connective tissue around eyes)
- kwashiorkor – protein malnutrition – low albumin
## increased capillary permeability
- allergy, inflammation, ACE inhibitors, burns and toxins
- reaction to ACE inhibitor – angioedema
	- ACE inhibitors increase bradykinin – increase capillary permeability as cells contract and intracellular spaces get bigger
- burns increase capillary permeability through several mechanisms, including direct cell damage, and inflammatory response so immune cells can reach damaged area
- cellulitis is a skin infection – oedema is due to both increased capillary permeability and increased hydrostatic pressure from vasodilation, but primary cause is increased capillary permeability
## lymphatic obstruction
- cancer obstructing lymphatics, surgery, trauma, infection
![microcirculation and oedema-20241213114824743.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/cr/week%202/attachments/microcirculation%20and%20oedema-20241213114824743.webp)
## myxoedema
- hypothyroidism
- oedema from accumulation glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) - long chains of sugar molecules – in interstitial tissue that attract and bind water molecules
- mon-pitting
	- fluid is not free in tissue but rather bound within matrix of GAGs 
		- creating gel-like consistency that doesn't easily displace under pressure
