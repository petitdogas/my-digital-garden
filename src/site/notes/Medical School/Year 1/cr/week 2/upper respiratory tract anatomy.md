# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Identify and describe the anatomy of the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, pharynx, larynx
- [ ] Understand clinical significance of the larynx

# Topology
## Upper respiratory tract
- nasal cavity and sinuses
- pharynx
## Lower respiratory tract
- larynx
- trachea
- bronchi
- lungs

# Functions of Paranasal Sinuses
- conditions air, warms, and moistens
- acts as an air reservoir
- reduces the overall weight of the cranium
- adds resonance to voice
- protection
- mechanical and thermal insulation of orbital contents (eyeballs) and cerebral hemispheres
- participates in cranial growth
- regulates intranasal pressure
- sinus epithelium releases high concentration of NO
