# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Define the terms pulse pressure and mean arterial pressure, state their range and calculate their values in the adult
- [ ] Explain the relationships between cardiac output, total peripheral resistance and mean arterial pressure
- [ ] Explain the concept of compliance, and the relationship between pulse pressure, stroke volume and compliance
- [ ] Comment on the importance of Poiseuille's law relating vessel radius and resistance to flow
- [ ] Comment on the importance of Laplace's law relating vessel radius and pressure

# Blood Flow
- directly proportional to pressure gradient and inversely proportional to resistance
> [!faq]- Equation
F = change in pressure/ resistance
- volume of blood that flows through a vessel or an organ over some period of time
## Laminar Flow
- blood flow at parallel layers usually at a lower velocity

- layer with the highest velocity flows in the centre of the vessel lumen
## Turbulent Flow
- random mixing of layers of blood creating murmurs and bruits
	- caused by narrowing of lumens, decreasing viscosity, and increasing velocity

# Blood Pressure
- systolic usually 120mmHg
- diastolic usually 80mmHg
- pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure
	- directly proportional to stroke volume
	- inversely proportional to arterial compliance

# Korotkoff Sounds
## Phase 1
- sharp tapping 
- first sound heard as the cuff pressure is released
- provides systolic pressure reading
## Phase 2
- whoosh of blood flowing through blood vessels as the cuff deflates
## Phase 3
- thumping as blood flows through artery
- cuff pressure is still inflated to occlude flow during diastole
## Phase 4
- softer blowing sound which fades as cuff pressure decreases
- first diastolic reading
## Phase 5
- cuff released to allow normal flow
- second diastolic reading

# Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)
- average arterial pressure during the cardiac cycle
- perfusion pressure of tissues and organs
- MAP of >60mmHg required to sustain organs

> [!faq]- Calculation
> MAP= 2/3 DBP +1/3 SBP
> MAP= DBP +1/3 Pulse pressure

# Vessel Diameter
- flow is proportional to r<sup>4</sup>
	- small changes in arterial diameter produce large changes in flow
		- affected by vasoconstriction and vasodilation
## Atherosclerosis
- atherosclerotic plaques reduce diameter of vessel
	- decreased flow

# Blood Viscosity
- thickness of blood
- depends on haematocrit
- blood flow is inversely proportional to the viscosity of blood
	- thicker blood flows less after all
## Clinical Conditions
- polycythaemia – when a person has too many red blood cells their blood becomes more viscous
- [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 2/causes of genetic mutations#Sickle Cell Disease\|sickle cell disease]] – malformed red blood cells that are inflexible can make blood more viscous
- macrocytosis – if blood cells are big, they can make the blood more viscous

# Compliance of Blood Vessels
- ability of a blood vessel wall to expand and contract **passively** with changes in pressure
- highly compliant vessels can stretch to accommodate large volumes with minimal increase in pressure difference

- compliance of large veins influences [[Medical School/Year 1/cr/week 1/heart as a pump#Preload\|preload]] on the heart
- compliance of aorta and large arteries reduces [[Medical School/Year 1/cr/week 1/heart as a pump#Afterload\|afterload]]
	- aorta accommodates blood ejected from the left ventricle and recoils back
		- preventing an excessive rise in systolic blood pressure

# Ageing
- as people age, blood vessels harden
	- atherosclerosis or calcification
	- therefore, higher BP required to pump blood
		- increase in aortic pulse pressure
