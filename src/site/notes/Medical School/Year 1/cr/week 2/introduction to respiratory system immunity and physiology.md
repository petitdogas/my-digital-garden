# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Describe lung immune mechanisms and how they protect against pathogens
- [ ] Define Intrapulmonary, intrapleural and transpulmonary pressures
- [ ] Explain mechanics of quiet inspiration and expiration and the changes in pressure occurring to enable ventilation
- [ ] Define lung compliance, lung elastic recoil, and radial traction and their roles in ventilation
- [ ] Define and describe factors affecting mechanics of ventilation including surfactant and airways resistance

# Immune Defences of the Lungs
## First line
- skin and mucous membranes
	- conchae spin air into a vortex so dust particles and airborne pathogens are thrown into the mucous
	- mucous contains antibodies and antibiotic peptides which can kill or immobilise pathogens
- cilia
	- moves mucous to back of throat to be swallowed and destroyed in stomach acid
		- mucociliary elevator

> [!tip]- Clinical Relevance - Cystic Fibrosis
> mucous is abnormally thick (due to genetic mutation), and difficult for cilia to move. People with CF require regular physiotherapy to ‘cough up’ and remove thick mucous decrease infection with pathogens

## Second line
- innate immune system
	- patrolling macrophages are phagocytic
	- neutrophils in response to bacterial infections
		- particularly important in alveoli, where there is no mucous lining
## Third line
- specific, acquired immunity
- B and T cells
	- antibodies

# Ventilation
- at rest
	- volume of air being moved = tidal volume
	- rhythmic and involuntary process
	- depends on lung compliance and elastic recoil
## why does the chest expand?
- pleural fluid forms pleural seal via surface tension
	- connects the visceral pleura to the parietal pleura
		- connecting the lungs to the thoracic cavity
## Inward Pull of the Lung Results in a Negative Pressure Between Pleura
- lungs have a natural elastic inwards recoil
- chest wall has a natural outwards recoil
- these two opposite forces create a negative pressure in the intrapleural space (pleural cavity)
	- negative pressure due to elastic recoil of lung pulling visceral pleura inward and chest wall elastic recoil pulling parietal pleura outward
		- intrapleural pressure negative throughout expiration and inspiration (becomes more negative up until end of inspiration) relative to atmosphere and intra-alveolar pressure
			- keeps alveoli/lungs from fully collapsing with each expiration
## Resting Expiratory Level (REL)
- lungs collapse inwards; chest wall pulls out
	- forces are equal and opposite, so no net force
- volume air at resting expiratory level is called Functional Residual Capacity (FRC)
	- occurs at end of expiration
## Pressure definitions
- intrapulmonary pressure: pressure inside alveoli/lungs
- intrapleural pressure: pressure in pleural space between visceral and parietal pleura
- transpulmonary pressure = intrapulmonary - intrapleural
## Inspiration
- diaphragm contracts and moves downward, and rib cage expands
	- increases thoracic cavity volume
		- intrapleural pressure becomes more negative (decreases further below atmospheric pressure)
			- increases the transpulmonary pressure, causing lungs and alveoli to expand
				- as alveoli expand, alveolar pressure drops below atmospheric pressure
					- this pressure difference causes air to flow into lungs until alveolar pressure equals atmospheric pressure
## Expiration
- during quiet expiration, cycle is reversed,
- inspiratory muscles relax and the inward elastic recoil of lungs results in decrease in lung volume
	- alveolar volume decreases
		- causes alveolar pressure > atmospheric pressure
			- air leaves the lungs until pressures equalise and no more air movement
				- intrapleural pressure remains negative relative to atmosphere, but less negative than at end inspiration
					- thus still positive transpulmonary pressure - alveoli do not completely collapse despite increased pressure within lung from lung elastic recoil decreasing lung volume
## Properties that affect ability to expand lungs, lungs to return to original volume;  and “resting lung” (equilibrium) volumes
- in tissues with high compliance (easier to stretch), elastic recoil is less
- in tissues with low compliance, elastic recoil (tendency to return to original size) is high
### Compliance
- measure of distensibility – change in volume relative to change in pressure

#### lung compliance
- inversely related to connective tissue surrounding alveoli - elastic fibers including collagen and other matrix elements within the lung parenchyma
- inversely related to alveolar fluid surface tension
### Elastance (elastic recoil)
- the tendency of something that has been distended to return to its original size
## Surfactant
- secreted by type II pneumocytes
- more effective at disrupting surface tension when its molecules are closer together
	- i.e. around smaller alveoli
- less effective around bigger alveoli because surfactant molecules are more spread out
	- this results in all the alveoli having the same surface tension (as bigger ones have less surfactant and smaller ones have more proportionally)

## Airways
- ventilation must overcome resistance in the airways, dependent on
	- surface tension within airways
	- airway diameter
		- smaller diameter has larger resistance
		- mucous in membrane, remodelling, bronchial smooth muscle tone, intrapulmonary pressure gradients, radial traction
### radial traction
- leads to bronchioles remaining open in expiration
- outward tugging action of the surrounding alveolar walls on bronchioles
	- prevents collapse of bronchioles during expiration

# Summary
Ventilation is movement of air into and out of our lungs

Governed by lung and thoracic cavity mechanical properties and forces

(Quiet) Inspiration active process – Boyle’s Law- increase volume, decrease pressure: intrapleural pressure falls, transpulmonary pressure gradient increases, intrapulmonary pressure < atmospheric and air travels inwards

(Quiet) Expiration passive process – Boyle’s law - decrease volume, decrease pressure: intrapleural pressure increases, transpulmonary pressure gradient decreases, intrapulmonary pressure >atmospheric and air travels outwards

Pleural seal connects visceral and parietal pleura so that when chest cavity expands so do lungs

Balance of compliance and elastance required for optimal ventilation

Surfactant lowers alveolar surface tension – diluted in larger alveoli so that even though they are bigger Boyle’s law partially countered- keeps smaller alveoli inflated

Ventilation has to overcome airways resistance – numerous small airways running in parallel creates effective massive diameter and hence low resistance - can be affected by disease

Ventilation bronchioles and alveoli requires radial traction
