# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Describe the anatomy of the chest wall
- [ ] Name the major and accessory muscles involved in inspiration
- [ ] Understand the nerves involved in inspiration

- [ ] Describe the blood supply to the lungs
- [ ] Describe the structure and function of the pleura
- [ ] Trace the route of blood through the pulmonary circuit

# Thoracic Apertures
thoracic apertures allow structures to pass into and out of the thorax

## Superior thoracic aperture (inlet)
- manubrium
- 1st ribs
- T1 vertebrae
## Inferior thoracic aperture
- xiphoid process
- costal margin
- 12th ribs
- T12 vertebrae

# Respiratory Muscles

| Inspiration               | Expiration                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **external intercostals** | **internal intercostals** |
| **diaphragm**             | abdominal muscles         |
| scalenes                  | external intercostals     |
| sternocleidomastoid       |                           |
| pectoralis minor          |                           |

## Pectoralis major
- most superficial
- clavicular head and sternal head
- crosses the shoulder joint - has action on humerus
	- allows flexion

## Pectoralis minor
![lower respiratory tract anatomy-20241211121753021.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/cr/week%202/attachments/lower%20respiratory%20tract%20anatomy-20241211121753021.webp)
## Intercostal muscles
- external intercostals
- internal intercostals
- innermost intercostals
![lower respiratory tract anatomy-20241211121823384.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/cr/week%202/attachments/lower%20respiratory%20tract%20anatomy-20241211121823384.webp)
## Transversus thoracis
![lower respiratory tract anatomy-20241211121954320.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/cr/week%202/attachments/lower%20respiratory%20tract%20anatomy-20241211121954320.webp)
## Diaphragm
- innervated by phrenic nerves (C3, C4, C5)
- striated muscle
- domed when relaxed, flattened when contracted
- increases upper airway patency
- allows the IVC, aorta, and oesophagus to pass through
	- (T8, T10, T12)
		- I ate ten eggs at twelve

# Neurovasculature to chest wall
- neurovascular bundle located in the subcostal groove
	- intercostal vein (anterior or posterior)
	- intercostal artery (anterior or posterior)
	- intercostal nerve

- posterior intercostal vein → azygos vein
- anterior intercostal vein → internal thoracic vein
- thoracic aorta → posterior intercostal artery
- internal thoracic artery → anterior intercostal artery
- ventral rami of the spinal nerve → intercostal nerve 

# Trachea
- begins at cricoid cartilage
- [[Medical School/Year 1/cr/week 2/respiratory system histology#Trachea\|C-shaped cartilage]] separated by annular ligaments
	- C-shaped so oesophagus can expand into trachea if needed
- posteriorly trachealis muscle
- right primary bronchus is more vertical than the left
	- so foreign objects more likely to be found in right lung

# Respiratory Tree
- lobe supplied by lobar bronchi
	- 3 on right, 2 on left
	- lobar bronchi divide into segmental bronchi
		- divide into terminal bronchiole
			- alveolar sacs at distal end of terminal bronchiole

# Lungs
![lower respiratory tract anatomy-20241211124148629.webp|1328](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/cr/week%202/attachments/lower%20respiratory%20tract%20anatomy-20241211124148629.webp)
- apex of lungs lie 2cm above clavicle
- cardiac notch at 4th rib
- lungs at ribs 6, 8 and 10
- [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 6/introduction to body cavities#Pleura\|pleura]] at ribs 8, 10 and 12
- pleural sacs are larger than the lungs during quiet respiration
	- costophrenic recess (potential space)
