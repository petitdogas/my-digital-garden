# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Describe the changes in the type of epithelium throughout the respiratory system
- [ ] Explain how the structure of different segments of the respiratory airways reflect the functional roles that these airways play in air movement and gas exchange
- [ ] Distinguish the trachea, bronchi, terminal bronchioles, bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli based on key structural features
- [ ] Identify the different types of pneumocytes and their functions
- [ ] Recognise key pathological conditions associated with the respiratory tract

## nasal vestibule
- dilated space inside the nostrils
## respiratory region
- largest part (inferior 2/3) lined by respiratory mucosa
- ciliated, pseudostratified columnar epithelium
	- goblet cells - tall, columnar
	- brush cells - short microvilli
	- basal cells - stem cells
- warms, moistens, and filters inspired air
- lamina propria contains seromucous glands, which drain to surface via small ducts
- vessels have muscular walls (contract/dilate) for temperature regulation and secretions
## olfactory region
- apex of each cavity
- lined by olfactory mucosa
	- superior concha and superior nasal septum

# Pharynx
connective tissue with mucous glands.
underlying elastic layer
## nasopharynx
- both ciliated respiratory-type epithelium and stratified squamous epithelium
## oropharynx and laryngopharynx
- non-keratinised stratified squamous epithelium

# Larynx
## vocal folds / vocal chords
- covered by non-keratinised stratified squamous epithelium
- underlying skeletal muscle
	- vocalis muscles
## ventricular folds / false vocal chords
- create sound resonance
- covered by respiratory mucosa
	- mucous glands in connective tissue (protection)
## epiglottis
- non-keratinised stratified squamous and respiratory epithelium

# Trachea

## mucosa
- ciliated, pseudostratified columnar epithelium
- elastic-rich lamina propria
## submucosa
- serous and mucous glands
- blood vessels
- nerve fibres
## cartilaginous layer
- C-shaped hyaline cartilage
- rings joined posteriorly by bands of smooth muscle
	- trachealis muscle
## adventitia
- connective tissue which binds the trachea

# Bronchi
- different to trachea because NO C-SHAPED RINGS
	- just fragments of hyaline cartilage
## mucosa
- respiratory epithelium
## muscularis
- smooth muscle cells
## submucosa
- glands
- connective tissue
## cartilage layer (chips)
## adventitia
- connective tissue

# Bronchioles
- no cartilage plates
- no glands
- goblet cells not found at terminal bronchioles
	- except in smokers
	- replaced with club cells which secrete
		- surfactant
			- watery surface-active lipoprotein
			- prevents luminal adhesion
		- secretory protein C16
			- associated with COPD and asthma
		- detoxifying compound
			- cytochrome P450
				- regenerates epithelium of small airways when damaged
- simple ciliated columnar/cuboidal epithelium
- thick layer of smooth muscle cell causes mucosa folding

## respiratory bronchioles
- lined by simple cuboidal epithelium
- walls have smooth muscle fibres
- alveolar ducts + [[Medical School/Year 1/cr/week 2/respiratory system histology#Alveoli\|alveoli]]

# Alveoli 
![respiratory system histology-20241210123730824.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/cr/week%202/attachments/respiratory%20system%20histology-20241210123730824.png)
- alveolar ducts
	- elongated airways with no walls
- alveolar sacs
	- spaces surrounded by clusters of alveoli
## pneumocytes I
- flat squamous cells
- line 95% of alveolar surface
- do not divide
## pneumoocytes II
- cuboidal cells
- only 5% of alveolar surface
- synthesise surfactant
	- decreases alveoli surface tension, preventing lung collapse
- replace type I cells after injury
## blood-air barrier
- four layers separate blood and air
	- capillary endothelium (continuous, no fenestrations)
	- fused basal lamina
	- alveolar epithelium (type I pneumocyte)
	- surfactant

# Lung Section

- NB: bronchi and bronchioles look similar
	- bronchioles lack cartilaginous plates

# Pleura
- [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 6/introduction to body cavities#Pleura\|visceral and parietal]]
- thin layer of mesothelial cells (flat-cuboidal cells, no nucleoli) upon thin basement membrane overlying fibroelastic connective tissue
- reactive mesothelial cells
	- larger, more conspicuous cells
	- enlarged nucleus with prominent central nucleoli 
- submesothelium 
	- spindled fibroblastic cells, collagen, elastin
