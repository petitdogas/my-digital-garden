## Posterior Triangle
![anatomy of the neck-1741698439064.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/anatomy%20of%20the%20neck-1741698439064.webp)
![anatomy of the neck-1741698453563.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/anatomy%20of%20the%20neck-1741698453563.webp)
- posterior border of sternocleidomastoid
- anterior border of trapezius
- middle 1/3 of clavicle
	- occipital
	- supraclavicular
### Important Structures
- CN XI
- external jugular vein runs superficially over the SCM
	- drains blood from face and superior part of neck + scalp
- lymph nodes
- part of subclavian artery
- brachial plexus, cervical plexus, phrenic nerve
#### Prominence of EJV
![anatomy of the neck-1741698819690.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/anatomy%20of%20the%20neck-1741698819690.webp)
- works as a barometer - can be used to estimate pressure
- usually visible above clavicle for short distance (about 4-5cm above sternal angle)
	- raised pressure = EJV prominent throughout course
		- heart failure, SVC obstruction, enlarged supraclavicular lymph nodes, raised intrathoracic pressure
		- EJV helps assess mean right atrial pressure
			- nearly identical to central venous pressure
#### CN XI - Accessory
![anatomy of the neck-1741698929147.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/anatomy%20of%20the%20neck-1741698929147.webp)
- innervates SCM and trapezius - accessory to breathing
- forms from C1-5 spinal cord rootlets
- ascend into cranial cavity via foramen magnum
- exits through jugular foramen (which has CN IX X XI)
##### Injury
![anatomy of the neck-1741699012394.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/anatomy%20of%20the%20neck-1741699012394.webp)
![anatomy of the neck-1741699263916.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/anatomy%20of%20the%20neck-1741699263916.webp)
- weakened shrugging shoulder, atrophy of trapezius, drooping of shoulder
- injury can be due to lymph node surgery in posterior triangle
- passive shoulder movements within normal range
- unilateral lesion usually does not produce an abnormal head position
	- weakness in turning head to opposite side against resistance
#### Cervical Plexus
- C1-4
	- cutaneous branches emerge around middle of the posterior border of SCM
	- phrenic nerve descends down obliquely with IJV
		- crosses the anterior scalene and passes into thorax
	- ansa cervicalis (C1-3)
		- motor to infrahyoid muscles
			- sternohyoid, sternothyroid, thyrohyoid and omohyoid muscles
## Anterior Triangle

- common carotid
	- at anterior border of SCM at level of thyroid cartilage
	- pulse indicates a systolic of at least 40mmHg
- carotid bifurcation
	- superior border of thyroid cartilage
- carotid sinus (IX) baroreceptors
	- feedback to heart to modulate pressure

# The Carotid Sheath
![anatomy of the neck-1741700291110.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/anatomy%20of%20the%20neck-1741700291110.webp)
- common and internal carotid arteries, internal jugular vein, and CN X
	- escaping upper sheath are CN IX, superior laryngeal nerve (branch of vagus), spinal root of CN XI and CN XII
- ansa cervicalis is over internal jugular vein
- ascending sympathetic fibres use internal carotid artery for support
![anatomy of the neck-1741700342456.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/anatomy%20of%20the%20neck-1741700342456.webp)
## Sympathetic Trunk
- cervical part of sympathetic trunk
	- three cervical ganglia
		- superior, middle, and inferior cervical ganglia
- receive presynpatic fibres via superior thoracic nerves
- synapse in ganglia to send fibres to
	- cervical spinal nerves
	- thoracic viscera
	- head and neck viscera
![anatomy of the neck-1741700559573.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/anatomy%20of%20the%20neck-1741700559573.webp)
### Horner's Syndrome
![anatomy of the neck-1741700670223.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/anatomy%20of%20the%20neck-1741700670223.webp)
- damage to sympathetic trunk in neck (or damage to brainstem)
- miosis (contraction of pupil)
- drooping of superior eyelid (paralysis of smooth muscle in levator palpebrae superioris)
- sinking of eye (enophthalmos, pseudo-enopthalmos)
- vasodilation
- anhidrosis (absence of sweating)
#### Pharmacological testing for Horner's syndrome
- topical 0.5-1% apraclonidine
	- alpha2 adrenergic agonist
	- weak alpha1 adrenergic agonist
- causes dilation of affected pupil and possible lid elevation, but not change in normal eye
- good at diagnosing, but not localising where the damage is
	- is it in the neck or in the brainstem?

# Surgical Dissection of Carotid Triangle
![anatomy of the neck-1741700807899.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/anatomy%20of%20the%20neck-1741700807899.webp)
- damage or compression of vagus and/or recurrent laryngeal nerves during surgery of carotid triangle may produce an alteration in voice
	- since these nerves supply laryngeal muscles

# IJV Puncture
![anatomy of the neck-1741700872534.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/anatomy%20of%20the%20neck-1741700872534.webp)
![anatomy of the neck-1741700876047.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/anatomy%20of%20the%20neck-1741700876047.webp)
- use point of care ultrasound
- right IJV used - straighter course with brachiocephalic vein into SVC
- thoracic duct (main lymph trunk) drains at venous angle on the left
## Internal Jugular Pulse (JVP)
- pulsation gives information about right atrial pressure
- no valves in brachiocephalic vein and SVC, so blood can travel up vein when at 45 degrees
- raised JVP could indicate
	- mitral valve disease
	- increased pressure in pulmonary circulation
	- right side of heart issues

# Muscles in anterior cervical region
## Suprahyoid
- floor of mouth
	- provide a base for tongue and elevate hyoid and larynx
		- swallowing and tone production
		- mylohyiod, digastric, stylohyoid
## Infrahyoid
- strap muscles depress hyoid and larynx during dwallowing and speaking
	- sternohyoid, thyrohyoid, sternothyroid, omohyoid
## Extrinsic Muscles
- suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscles
	- facial and mandibular trigeminal and ansa cervicalis

# Larynx - muscles and innervation
![anatomy of the neck-1741701200428.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/anatomy%20of%20the%20neck-1741701200428.webp)
- intrinsic muscles move the laryngeal components, altering the length and tension of vocal folds, size, and shape of rima glottidis
- cricothyroid  - superior laryngeal nerve (CN X)
- all others  - recurrent laryngeal nerve (CN X)
## Variation in rima glottidis
![anatomy of the neck-1741701213842.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/anatomy%20of%20the%20neck-1741701213842.webp)
- rima glottidis is the aperture between vocal folds
- normal respiration
	- laryngeal muscles relaxed and rima glottidis is a narrow slit
- deep respiration
	- vocal ligaments abducted by contraction of posterior cricoarytenoid muscles
		- rima glottidis opens widely
	- arytenoid muscles adduct arytenoid cartilages
		- at the same time, cricoarytenoids moderately adduct vocal ligaments
			- air forced between vocal ligaments = sound
- whispering
	- vocal ligaments strongly adducted, but relaxed arytenoids
## Innervation
![anatomy of the neck-1741701349557.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/anatomy%20of%20the%20neck-1741701349557.webp)
- vagus nerve
	- superior laryngeal nerve
		- internal laryngeal (sensory + autonomic) to larynx above vocal folds
		- external laryngeal nerve (motor to cricothyroid)
	- recurrent laryngeal nerve
		- motor to all other intrinsic muscles of the larynx and sensory to area below vocal folds
		- on left, recurrent laryngeal loops under the arch of the aorta
		- on right, recurrent laryngeal loops under the right subclavian artery
### Paralysis of superior laryngeal nerve
![anatomy of the neck-1741701473871.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/anatomy%20of%20the%20neck-1741701473871.webp)
- can occur during thyroidectomy or through compression 
	- goitre 
- anaesthesia of superior laryngeal mucosa
	- cough reflex
- paralysed cricothyroid
	- (unable to vary length and tension – but may go unnoticed)
- paralysed vocal folds cause hoarseness and dysphonia
