- outer: auditory canal (external auditory meatus), earlobe
- middle: eardrum (tympanic membrane) and the ossicles (three bones that transmit sound mechanically called the malleus, incus, stapsus --> these vibrate as sound enters)
- inner: contains the oval window that connects the middle with inner ear + the cochlea, semi-circular canals and the auditory tube
# Functions of the Auditory System

## Function of the Middle Ear
![hearing-1741702552401.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/hearing-1741702552401.webp)
### Impendence Matching
- difference in area between eardrum and oval window compensates for impendence mismatch between the air and the cochlear fluid
	- (sound travels differently in fluid vs air, which is compensated for)
### Sound Amplification
- sound is amplified as it moves from the tympanum to the oval window (due to the smaller area)
## Inner Ear (Cochlear) Functions
![hearing-1741703430859.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/hearing-1741703430859.webp)
- splits complex sounds into simple components 
- amplifies sound signals (outer hair cells)
- converts mechanical signals into electrical signals
	- (by opening or closing potassium channels depending on the direction that hairs move)
### Anatomy of the Cochlea
![hearing-1741702778337.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/hearing-1741702778337.webp)
- vibrational displacement
- pass into cochlear fluids at the oval window
	- function is to transform these vibrations into a neural signal
- three canals
	- scala vestibule
	- scala tympani
	- scala media
### Unwound Cochlea
- basement membrane is thin and wide at apex, but thick and narrow at the base
- organisation is in terms of frequency
	- different frequencies activate different parts of the basement membrane
		- high frequency at base
		- low frequency at apex

# Auditory Reflexes
- function to prevent damage and distinguish sounds from background noise
## Attenuation Reflex
- has a delay of 50 – 100ms so not very good against sudden loud noises
- activated by own voice or loud sounds
	- the contraction of muscles (including the stapedius) dampens the transmission from the middle to inner ear to prevent damage
- preference for low frequencies
	- able to distinguish higher frequencies (e.g. voices) a lot easier
## Startle (blink) Reflex
- involves facial nerve and reticular formation
- protects the back of the neck as well as the eye in response to sudden and loud/threatening noise

# Loudness
![hearing-1741702996027.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/hearing-1741702996027.webp)
- variations in air pressure over time measured by intensity

# Auditory Pathway
- travels from the cochlear nucleus to the superior olivary nucleus (important for spatial awareness)
	- then to inferior colliculus, to the medial geniculate nucleus
		- finally reaches the primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe
## Ventral Cochlea Nucleus
- fast, precise, projects to superior olivary nucleus
- encodes the intensity/timing of noise
## Dorsal Cochlea Nucleus
- complex responses
- project to lateral lemniscus and encode the quality of sound.
## Functions of Auditory Pathway
- identify complex auditory sounds
- detect changes in auditory environment
- learn about behaviourally relevant sounds
- integrate attention and auditory processing
- higher functions: language and musical appreciation
## Damage to Auditory Pathway
- tested by tuning fork tests (Rinne’s test and Weber’s test)
- test for conduction deafness and sensorineural deafness (cause lies in the inner or sensory organ)
### Rinne’s Test
![hearing-1741703374452.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/hearing-1741703374452.webp)
- tuning fork placed on mastoid process
- air to bone conduction
	- determines relative sensitivity in each ear separately
- conduction:
	- bone conduction better than air conduction on affected side
- sensorineural:
	- air conduction is better than bone in affected ear. Sound loudest: unaffected
### Weber's Test
![hearing-1741703389413.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/hearing-1741703389413.webp)
- tuning fork placed on forehead
	- sound should be heard in both ears
- conduction:
	- sound is louder in affected area.
- sensorineural:
	- sound is louder in unaffected area. 

# Effects of Damage to Language Areas
- Wernicke: fluent meaningless speech
	- severely impaired speech understanding
- Broca: abbreviated, ungrammatical but meaningful speech
	- speech understanding impaired where syntax conveys meaning
- Arcuate fasciculus: conduction aphasia
- Angular gyrus: alexia (can't read) with agraphia (can't write) but can comprehend speech and speak
	- abnormal in dyslexia

# Tumours and Lesions of the Internal Auditory Canal, Cerebellopontine Angle, Skull Base
## Schwannoma

- benign neoplasms arising from sheath of cranial nerves. 
## Meningioma
![hearing-1741703686537.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/hearing-1741703686537.webp)
- second most common mass in the cerebellopontine angle
- comes from arachnoid meninges
