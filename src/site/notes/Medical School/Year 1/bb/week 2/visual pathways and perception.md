	- [ ] Visual fields
	- [ ] Pathways that control tracking an object

- [ ] Describe the key reflexes:
	- [ ] Pupillary light reflex (direct and consensual)
	- [ ] Accommodation reflex
	- [ ] Vestibulo-ocular reflex
	- [ ] Blink reflex

# Visual Field
![visual pathways and perception-1741829730100.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/visual%20pathways%20and%20perception-1741829730100.webp)
- entire area a person can see if they focus on a point straight ahead of them
- 130 degree field of view
- 2 degrees of sharp vision
- blind spot is approximately 15 degrees temporally to fovea
- overlapping of visual fields
	- partial decussation of optic nerves in optic chiasm
		- nasal parts of visual fields of one eye crosses over to undecussated temporal fibres on the other eye
			- optic tract has mixed nasal and temporal fibres
				- temporal half of left retina and nasal half of right retina both look at the right half of the visual world
## Optic Nerve to Optic Chasm
![visual pathways and perception-1741829861125.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/visual%20pathways%20and%20perception-1741829861125.webp)
- eye inverts and reverses image onto retina (because of the lens)
- left nasal hemiretina of left eye projects to right visual cortex (purple part of image)
- right temporal hemiretina of right eye projects to right visual cortex (purple part of image)
- both hemiretina view objects in left and right field of view
- decussate in the optic chiasm
### Optic Chiasm
![visual pathways and perception-1741830373173.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/visual%20pathways%20and%20perception-1741830373173.webp)
![visual pathways and perception-1741830438449.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/visual%20pathways%20and%20perception-1741830438449.webp)
- located approximately 10mm superior to pituitary gland
- bitemporal hemianopsia from compression of decussating nasal fibres
	- ![visual pathways and perception-1741830472361.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/visual%20pathways%20and%20perception-1741830472361.webp)
	- temporal part of vision lost - only nasal remains
- compression of outer part of optic chiasm
	- binasal hemianopsia - very rare
		- calcification of internal carotids can impinge uncrossed lateral retinal fibres = loss of nasal field
			- ![visual pathways and perception-1741830580795.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/visual%20pathways%20and%20perception-1741830580795.webp)
## Optic Nerve Lesion
![visual pathways and perception-1741830085032.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/visual%20pathways%20and%20perception-1741830085032.webp)
- monocular blindness
- amaurosis fugax (dark fleeting)
	- sudden, short term, painless loss of vision in one eye
	- retinal transient ischaemic attack

# Optic Tract to Lateral Geniculate Nucleus
![visual pathways and perception-1742150990895.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/visual%20pathways%20and%20perception-1742150990895.webp)
- optic tract ends in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus
	- 90% of retinal nerve fibres in optic tract terminate here
	- 10% project to areas controlling pupil responses or circadian rhythm
		- pupillary fibres leave tract anterior to LGN and pass through the brachium to reach the pretectal nucleus at the level of the superior colliculus
- LGN gives rise to optic radiation
## Complete Optic Tract Lesion / Optic Radiation Lesion
![visual pathways and perception-1742151122905.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/visual%20pathways%20and%20perception-1742151122905.webp)
- contralateral homonymous hemianopsi
- brain tumours and aneurysms can compress the crossed nasal and uncrossed temporal fibres
	- bilateral hemifield loss opposite to the side of the lesion
## Optic Radiations to Primary Visual Cortex
![visual pathways and perception-1742151344100.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/visual%20pathways%20and%20perception-1742151344100.webp)
- optic radiations spread out once they leave the LGN
	- travel in white matter tracts of the cerebral hemispheres
- upper division (parietal lobe)
	- superior retinal quadrants = inferior visual quadrants
	- lesion leads to contralateral inferior quadrantopia
- lower division (temporal lobe, Meyer's loop)
	- inferior retinal quadrants = superior visual quadrants
	- lesion leads to contralateral superior quadrantopia
### Optic Radiations to Visual Cortex
- primary visual cortex is almost entirely on the medial surface of the occipital lobe
	- small portion of this extends around posterior pole onto the lateral surface of the occipital lobe
- calcarine fissure - parieto-occipital sulcus to posterior pole divides visual cortex into
	- upper portion = cuneus gyrus
	- lower portion = lingual gyrus
	- most of the primary visual cortex is buried here
- 50% of primary visual cortex processes foveal signals
	- majority of cones, so colour vision
- awareness of visual stimuli
	- detecting edges, lines, and orientations
#### Conscious Visual Perception
![visual pathways and perception-1742151850759.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%202/attachments/visual%20pathways%20and%20perception-1742151850759.webp)
- primary visual cortex sends cortico-cortical axons to surrounding secondary and visual association cortex
- V2 surrounds the primary cortex
	- colour, shape
	- V2 will further relay signals to V3,4,5
		- visual association cortex is extensive
			- whole of occipital lobe and adjacent posterior parietal lobe and inferior temporal lobe
		- data from retina converted into conscious perception
		- ventral stream = "what pathway"
			- recognition of objects - memory
				- facial recognition is in right hemisphere only
		- dorsal stream = "where pathway" or "how pathway"
			- associated with motion
