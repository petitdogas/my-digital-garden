# Resulting impairments depend on the level of injury
- cranial nerve damage is ipsilateral
	- most cranial nerves do not decussate, so damage to its nucleus or lower motor neurone causes IPSILATERAL loss
		- exceptions such as CN II, CN IV, CN VII and CN XII
- damage to cerebral cortex --> **CONTRALATERAL**
- damage to the cerebellum --> **IPSILATERAL**

# Cranial Nerves
## Olfactory - I
![cranial nerves-1742316497362.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/cranial%20nerves-1742316497362.webp)
- function – special sensory smell
- origin – cerebral cortex
- foramen – cribriform Plate
- disorders – loss of smell
- olfactory receptors in the nasal epithelium assemble into small bundles becoming the olfactory nerves piercing through the cribriform plate
	- ![cranial nerves-1742316541248.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/cranial%20nerves-1742316541248.webp)
## Optic - II
- function – special sensory vision
	- transmits special sensory information from retina to the primary visual cortex
- origin – cerebral cortex
- foramen – optic canal in the sphenoid
- disorders – loss of vision (various forms depending on where the lesion is)
- after the optic chiasm, most of the axons terminate in the lateral geniculate nucleus
	- information form here is relayed to the visual cortex
	- however, some axons will terminate in the pretectal nucleus
		- involved in reflexive eye movements
			- pupillary light reflex - afferent limb has nerve fibres running within the optic nerve (CN II) and the efferent limb has nerve fibres running along the oculomotor nerve (CN III)
- before the chiasm – visual field loss is **ipsilateral**
- after the chiasm – visual field loss is **contralateral as nerves have crossed over at chiasm**
### Testing - AFRO
