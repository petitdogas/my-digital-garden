# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Overview the reflex arc
- [ ] Describe muscle spindle structure and function
- [ ] Understand myotatic (tendon) reflexes
- [ ] Understand Golgi Tendon Organ structure and its reflex arc
- [ ] Understand flexion and crossed extensor reflexes
- [ ] Explore how CNS contributes the regulation of reflexes
- [ ] Describe the concept of lower motor neurone and upper motor neurone lesions

# Reflex Arc
- pathway of automatic, involuntary response to a stimulus
	- quick because they bypass the brain
		- less harm caused by touching a hot plate, for example
- flexion spinal reflex is hot plate, crossed extensor reflex is stepping on a nail
## Monosynpatic

- one synapse at the spinal cord
## Polysynaptic
![spinal reflexes-1741094033014.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/spinal%20reflexes-1741094033014.webp)
- several synapses in the reflex
	- multiple responses

# Perception of Muscle Stretch and Contraction
## Muscle Spindles
![spinal reflexes-1741094163899.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/spinal%20reflexes-1741094163899.webp)
- responds to movements of the body (not external stimuli)
	- proprioceptor since you know your position in space
- main sensory nerve fibre from the spindle is called **1a afferent**
- sensory --> mediates all the tendon reflexes
- complex encapsulated intrafusal fibres
![spinal reflexes-1741094252885.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/spinal%20reflexes-1741094252885.webp)
- centre of the fibre has lots of cell bodies and mitochondria, but no actin/myosin and no connective tissue
	- easily stretched, which is detected
		- deformation of the 1a sensory afferents produces action potentials
			- mechanically gated Na+ channels
				- tapping tendons stretches this too (think bicep/patellar reflex)
### Muscle Spindle Regulation
- special motor neurone - **gamma motor neurone**
	- stimulates contraction of the intrafusal fibres (basically pre-stretching of centre)
		- stops spindles from becoming slack and insensitive to changes in stretch
			- by firing action potentials
	- driven from descending motor pathways e.g. corticospinal tract
### Muscle Contraction - tetanus fusion frequency
- contraction of one [[Medical School/Year 1/loco/week 2/neuromuscular junction#Small and Large Motor Units\|motor unit]] by action potential generates a twitch
	- motor unit has to be activated by a certain sequence at a high frequency for smooth fused contraction
![spinal reflexes-1741094949235.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/spinal%20reflexes-1741094949235.webp)
- this is how healthy muscles normally work

### Tendon (myotatic) Reflexes
- [[Medical School/Year 1/loco/week 2/anatomy of the knee#Patellar Reflex\|knee]], ankle, biceps, triceps, supinator reflexes
- direct synaptic connection between the muscle spindle afferent and the motor neurone
	- direct connection makes it hard for the brain to suppress the reflex
#### Patellar Reflex
![spinal reflexes-1741095435353.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/spinal%20reflexes-1741095435353.webp)
- assess the integrity of the nervous system, particularly the L2-L4 spinal segments, as well as peripheral and central pathways
- maintaining posture and balance
- muscle tone regulation
- proprioception
- protection against overstretching
#### Neural Sharpening of Myotatic Reflexes
![spinal reflexes-1741095578996.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/spinal%20reflexes-1741095578996.webp)
#### Loss of Central Inhibition - UMN lesions (hyperreflexia)
![spinal reflexes-1741095615817.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/spinal%20reflexes-1741095615817.webp)
#### LMN Lesions - Hyporeflexia / Absent Reflex
![spinal reflexes-1741095653092.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/spinal%20reflexes-1741095653092.webp)
#### Reciprocal Inhibition
- tendon tap that activates extensor reflex also inhibits the antagonist flexor muscle
	- action of an inhibitory interneurone
		- extensor contracts, flexor relaxes
### Central Regulation
![spinal reflexes-1741095414234.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/spinal%20reflexes-1741095414234.webp)
#### Pyramidal
- UMN cell bodies from frontal lobe to spinal cord to corticospinal tract to LMN
#### Extrapyramidal
- UMN from brainstem to spinal cord, regulated by motor cortex
#### Spinal Cord
- LMN in ventral horn down via peripheral nerve to muscles
## Golgi Tendon Organ (GTO)
![spinal reflexes-1741095769513.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/spinal%20reflexes-1741095769513.webp)
- second major proprioceptor in muscle
	- activated by **muscle tension** rather than length
### Perception of muscle stretch via GTO
- at the junction between the tendon and muscle tissue
- mechanically gated sodium channels
- type **1b** fibres
### Golgi Tendon Reflex / Autogenic Inhibition / Reciprocal Activation
![spinal reflexes-1741095869766.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/spinal%20reflexes-1741095869766.webp)
#### Clinical Significance
- protection against tendon and muscle injury, preventing excessive contraction
- regulation of muscle tone in spasticity and hyperreflexia
	- in UMN lesions, GTO function is dysregulated
		- spasticity and hyperreflexia
		- present with
			- increased tone, rigidity exaggerated reflexes 
				- cerebral palsy or multiple sclerosis

# Key Clinical Applications of Flexor and Crossed Extensor Reflexes
## Exaggerated flexor and crossed-extensor reflexes
- UMN lesions (loss of descending inhibition)
## Absent reflexes
- LMN lesions
## Reflex hypersensitivity in pain disorders
- abnormal sensory processing
## Coma Assessment
- presence of flexor withdrawal reflex suggests intact spinal function
	- absence may indicate brainstem dysfunction
