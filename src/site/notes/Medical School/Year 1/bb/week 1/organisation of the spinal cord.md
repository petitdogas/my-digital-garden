### Dura mater
- attached to the inside of the skull
- folds back on itself (double layered)
	- periosteal layer attached to the bones of the skull
	- meningeal layer fused with the periosteal layer (except at dural sinuses)
	- falx cerebri, tentorium cerebelli and falx cerebelli are double layers of meningeal layer
	- forms venous sinuses e.g. superior sagittal sinus
- thick, fibrous
#### Nerve Supply
- CN V and X
	- referred pain to the head from above the tentorium cerebelli
- spinal nerves C1-3
- sympathetic
#### Blood Supply
- internal carotid, external carotid, and vertebral arteries
	- middle meningeal artery biggest branch of exernal carotid
		- think of a pterion injury
### Arachnoid mater
![introduction to the central nervous system-1742296849745.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/introduction%20to%20the%20central%20nervous%20system-1742296849745.webp)
- avascular and not attached to meningeal dura
- thinner, more delicate
- outer compact layer (barrier cells) and inner trabecular meshwork containing CSF
- subarachnoid space filled with CSF, which buffers and protects the brain and spinal cord
### Pia mater
- thin membrane loosely connected to arachnoid
- attached to the basement lamina of the brain
- only absent at natural openings between ventricles
	- median and lateral apertures

- white matter is **myelinated axons**
	- region of information transmission
- grey matter is **non-myelinated components**
	- cell bodies, synapses
		- region of information processing
![organisation of the spinal cord-1741086887213.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/organisation%20of%20the%20spinal%20cord-1741086887213.webp)

## Peripheral Nerves
- 31 pairs of spinal nerves
	- **8** cervical (because there's an extra one between skull and first vertebrae)
	- **12** thoracic
	- **5** lumbar
	- **5** sacral
	- **1** coccygeal
- spinal nerve named according to vertebrae above except in cervical
- below L1/2, the spinal nerves form the **cauda equina**
## Lumbar Punctures and Epidurals
- performed below level **L3** to avoid damage to spinal cord
- clinically relevant: spinal cord ends at a different region in children vs adults due to different rates of bone/nerve growth
	- ![organisation of the spinal cord-1741087431145.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/organisation%20of%20the%20spinal%20cord-1741087431145.webp)

- very little white matter
- predominantly grey matter
## Blood Supply to the Spinal Cord
![organisation of the spinal cord-1741087709209.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/organisation%20of%20the%20spinal%20cord-1741087709209.webp)
- vertebral artery branches off subclavian artery
	- through the transverse foramen in cervical vertebrae
		- large branch - **basilar** artery
		- small branches - **anterior spinal** arteries (which anastomose)
		- smaller branches - **posterior spinal** arteries (one on each side)
- anterior and posterior spinal arteries are not enough to supply whole cord
	- reinforced by **radiculospinal** arteries, which are derived from arteries of the body wall

## Spinal Tracts
![organisation of the spinal cord-1741088909682.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/organisation%20of%20the%20spinal%20cord-1741088909682.webp)
### Sensory
#### Spinothalamic Tract
- transmits sensation of crude touch pain and temperature from the spinal cord to the thalamus
![organisation of the spinal cord-1741088260554.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/organisation%20of%20the%20spinal%20cord-1741088260554.webp)
- enters dorsal horn of grey and decussates in the **spinal cord**
	- decussation is why the left brain controls the right body and vice versa
	- reaches the thalamus
- the first order neurone transmits the sensation along the spinal nerve and travels via the dorsal root into the spinal cord
- in the spinal cord, the first order neurone synapses with the second order neurone in the dorsal horn of grey
- the second order neurone then decussates to reach the contralateral spinothalamic tract
- the second order neuron travels via the spinothalamic tract up to the thalamus
- in the thalamus, the secondary order neurone synapses with the third order neurone
- the third order neurone travels via the internal capsule to the primary somatosensory cortex
#### Dorsal Column Medial Lemniscus (DCML)
- fasciculus cuneatus for upper limb
![organisation of the spinal cord-1741088553153.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/organisation%20of%20the%20spinal%20cord-1741088553153.webp)
- transmits sensations of vibration, proprioception, and discriminative touch
	- via dorsal columns and medial lemniscus
		- decussates in the **medulla**
- fasciculus gracilis for lower limb
![organisation of the spinal cord-1741088625859.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/organisation%20of%20the%20spinal%20cord-1741088625859.webp)
- the first order neurone transmits the sensation along the spinal nerve and travels via the dorsal root into the spinal cord
- in the spinal cord, the first order neurone does not synapse but runs into the dorsal column (fasiculus gracilis from the lower limb, fasciculus cuneatus from the upper limb)
- the first order neurone ascends in the spinal cord along the ipsilateral dorsal column to enter the medulla
- in the medulla, the first order neurone synapses with the second order neurone within the cunate or gracile nucleus respectively and then decussates to reach the medial lemniscus
- the second order neurone travels via the medial lemniscus to reach the thalamus
- in the thalamus, the secondary order neurone synapses with the third order neurone
- the third order neurone travels via the internal capsule to the primary somatosensory cortex
#### Spinocerebellar
- transmits subconscious proprioception (position in space) from the spinal cord to the cerebellum
![organisation of the spinal cord-1741088744799.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/organisation%20of%20the%20spinal%20cord-1741088744799.webp)
- the first order neurone transmits the sensation along the spinal nerve and travels via the dorsal root into the spinal cord
- in the spinal cord, the first order neurone synapses in the dorsal horn of grey
- the second order neurone enters the ipsilateral spinocerebellar tract and ascends to the cerebellum
### Motor
- refer to [[Medical School/Year 1/bb/week 1/the voluntary control of movement\|the voluntary control of movement]]
#### Corticospinal
- transmits motor signals from the cortex to the spinal cord
![organisation of the spinal cord-1741088824793.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/organisation%20of%20the%20spinal%20cord-1741088824793.webp)
- the first order neurone has its cell body in the primary motor cortex and the axon projects along the internal capsule to reach the brainstem
- the first order neurones run anteriorly in the brainstem and enter the medullary pyramids
- in the pyramids, the majority of fibres decussate to enter the corticospinal tract
- from the corticospinal tract the first order neurones [[Medical School/Year 1/bb/week 1/the voluntary control of movement#Corticospinal Tract (Corticobulbar Tract)\|descend]] to the level of innervation and enter the ventral horn of grey and synapse with the second order neurones
- the second order neurone travels out of the spinal cord via the ventral root and into the spinal nerve to reach skeletal muscle
## Spinal Cord Injury
### Central Cord
![organisation of the spinal cord-1741089036939.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/organisation%20of%20the%20spinal%20cord-1741089036939.webp)
- upper limb weakness, sensory loss below level of injury
- more frequently upper limb, where motor function more severely impaired than sensory function
## Brown-Sequard
- paralysis and loss of proprioception/vibration/discriminative touch on the ipsilateral side as the injury (due to decussation)
- loss of pain and temperature sensation on the opposite (or contralateral) side as the lesion
