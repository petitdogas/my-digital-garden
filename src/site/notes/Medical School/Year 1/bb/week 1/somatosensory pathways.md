# Learning Objectives
- [ ] Describe the anatomy and physiology of the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway and explain how its integrity may be clinically assessed
- [ ] Describe the anatomy of the spinothalamic tracts
- [ ] Explain the role of the different components of the spinothalamic tracts in sensation and pain
- [ ] Describe and compare some clinical manifestations of lesions of the spinal cord

# Ascending Pathways
- 3 neurone relay
	- dorsal root ganglion ---> spinal cord / brainstem ---> thalamus ---> cortex
	- fourth neurone receives information within the somatosensory cortex

# Somatosensation
## DCML (Dorsal Column-Medial Lemniscus)

- Ia, Ib (Aα, conscious proprioception) and II (Aβ, touch; vibration) large-diameter sensory nerve fibres
- at the base of the columns, the regions fuse together and contain Aβ afferents from the **thorax and abdomen**
### DCML pathway
- fibres of the dorsal columns originate from first-order neurones in the **dorsal root ganglion** (DRG)
- medial lemniscus fibres originate from second-order neurones in the **cuneate or gracile nuclei in the lower medulla**
- **thalamocortical fibres** in the internal capsule originate from third-order neurones in the **ventroposterolateral thalamus**

### Fasciculus gracilis

- information from **lower 6 thoracic segments, lumbar segments, sacral segments**
### Fsaciculus Cuneatus
![somatosensory pathways-1741097248777.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/somatosensory%20pathways-1741097248777.webp)
- information from **cervical segments and upper 6 thoracic segments**
### Dorsal Column Nuclei

### DCML decussates at medulla level
- axons from the dorsal column nuclei decussate
	- internal arcuate fibres
		- once crossed over, form the medial lemniscus
			- travels medially through the brainstem up to the **somatosensory thalamus**
#### Somatosensory thalamus is a relay to the cortex

## Spinocerebellar Tracts
- input to the cerebellum to guide cerebellar control of lower body muscle tone, movement, and posture
	- think about how walking and running are automatic
### Posterior Spinocerebellar Tract
- is uncrossed
	- ascends ipsilaterally in the brainstem
		- enters cerebellum through the inferior cerebellar peduncle on the same side
- proprioceptive afferents from [[Medical School/Year 1/bb/week 1/spinal reflexes#Muscle Spindles\|muscle spindles]], [[Medical School/Year 1/bb/week 1/spinal reflexes#Golgi Tendon Organ (GTO)\|golgi tendon organs]], and joint receptors from trunk and lower limbs
	- C8-L3 (Clarke's Column)
		- C1-7 from cuneocerebellar tract
### Anterior Spinocerebellar Tract
![somatosensory pathways-1741098188308.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/somatosensory%20pathways-1741098188308.webp)
- is crossed
	- travels up contralaterally
		- enters cerebellum through superior cerebellar peduncle
			- crosses again in the brainstem to return to ipsilateral side
# Pain and Temperature
- pain sensation (nociception) usually triggered by tissue damage
	- receptors are called nociceptors
		- mechanical, thermal, polymodal
			- information travels through two different fibres
				- **A-delta fibres** = fast pain
					- smaller and more numerous cutaneous receptive fields
				- **C fibres** = slow pain
					- accurate location of painful stimulus
