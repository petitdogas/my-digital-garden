- sympathetic - short preganglion, long postganglionic
- parasympathetic - long preganglionic, short postganglionic
![autonomic nervous system-1741176718400.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/autonomic%20nervous%20system-1741176718400.webp)
- sympathetic - Ach preganglionic then noradrenaline postganglionic
- parasympathetic - Ach then Ach

# Sympathetic Neurotransmission
![autonomic nervous system-1741177751887.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/autonomic%20nervous%20system-1741177751887.webp)
- pregnaglionic neurones release Ach in the ganglion to activate the postganglionic neurone
	- all autonomic ganglia are cholinergic nicotinic
- postganglionic sympathetic neurones project to the target tissue
	- e.g. smooth muscle in arterioles for vasoconstriction
- postganglionic neurone releases noradrenaline to act on the adrenoreceptors
	- except sweat glands, which are cholinergic
## Synthesis of catecholamines
- tyrosine --- tyrosine hydroxylase ---> DOPA --- DOPA decarboxylase ---> dopamine --- dopamine beta-hydroxylase ---> noradrenaline --- PNMT ---> adrenaline
## Adrenoreceptors

## Basic organisation of the SNS
- leaves spinal cord at T1-L2
- sympathetic ganglia found on the posterior wall of the ribcage
	- contain cell bodies of post-ganglionic sympathetic nerves
		- form a sympathetic chain / trunk
### The Sympathetic Chain
- preganglionic nerve can have three destinations
	- the sympathetic trunk ganglion at the same spinal level
	- the sympathetic trunk ganglion at the higher or lower spinal level
	- a prevertebral ganglion
- this divergence allows mass action to be coordinated simultaneously
## Cervical Ganglia
- receive preganglionic nerves from the thoracic spinal cord
![autonomic nervous system-1741177360747.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/autonomic%20nervous%20system-1741177360747.webp)
### Superior Cervical Ganglion
- innervates:
	- blood vessels and sweat glands in face and scalp
	- dilator muscles of the iris
	- parotid gland
	- heart
### Middle Cervical Ganglion
- innervates:
	- thyroid gland
	- heart
### Inferior Cervical Ganglion
- upper thoracic organs (lungs)
- heart (through cardiac plexus)
- blood vessels in upper chest and arms
## Thoracic Ganglia (T1-T12)
- inferior cervical ganglion often merges with the first thoracic ganglion
	- forms stellate ganglion - heart and upper limbs
### Upper Thoracic Ganglia (T1-T4)
- send fibres to the heart and lungs, contributing to cardiac acceleration and bronchodilation
- supply blood vessels, sweat glands, and arrector pili muscles in the chest wall and upper limbs
### Lower Thoracic Ganglia (T5-T12)
- contribute to the formation of the splanchnic nerves
## Splanchnic Nerves
### Greater splanchnic nerve (T5-T9)
- innervates the celiac ganglion and the abdominal organs (e.g., stomach, liver, spleen)
### Lesser splanchnic nerve (T10-T11)
- supplies the superior mesenteric ganglion and the midgut
### Least splanchnic nerve (T12)
- provides fibres to the renal plexus and kidneys
## Sympathetic regulation of the adrenal medulla
- differs from the typical two-neurone sympathetic pathway
- does not synapse at a ganglion
	- instead, preganglionic sympathetic neurones from the thoracic spinal cord (T5–T9) project directly to the adrenal medulla
		- release acetylcholine, which binds to nicotinic receptors on chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla
			- chromaffin cells produce 80% adrenaline and 20% noradrenaline

# Parasympathetic Neurotransmission
![autonomic nervous system-1741178150077.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/autonomic%20nervous%20system-1741178150077.webp)
- fully cholinergic
## Anatomy of the parasympathetic nervous system
- first neurone is either in the brainstem or the sacral spinal cord
- also known as the cranio-sacral autonomic outflow
- mostly CN X
## Cranial Parasympathetic Outflow (Ganglia)
- ciliary ganglion - oculomotor (CN III)
	- pupil constriction and bulging of lens
- pterygopalatine ganglion - facial (CN VII)
	- lacrimal glands and nasal glands
- submandibular ganglion - facial (CN VII)
	- salivation via sublingual and submandibular
- otic ganglion - glossopharyngeal (CN IX)
	- salivation via parotid
## Sacral Sympathetic Outflow
- S2-S4 spinal segments
- travel in the pelvic splanchnic nerve
- relay in parasympathetic ganglia to innervate the rectum, genitals and bladder
- maintenance of continence

# Central regulation of autonomic function
## Brain structures involved in ANS regulation

- NcTS – nucleus tractus solitarius
- NcAmb – nucleus ambiguous
- DMN Vagus – dorsomedial nucleus of CN X
## Autonomic regulation of the cardiovascular system

# Regulation by the ANS
## Parasympathetic Chronotropy
- SAN innervated by vagal and sympathetic autonomic nerve fibres
- parasympathetic nerves from vagus
	- release Ach --> muscarinic receptors
		- K+ channels open --> efflux of K+
			- decreases depolarisation rate
				- decreases AP rate
					- heart slows down (negative chronotropic effect)
## Sympathetic Chronotropy
![introduction to cardiac physiology-20241126144403586.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/cr/week%201/attachments/introduction%20to%20cardiac%20physiology-20241126144403586.png)
- noradrenaline acts on β1 adrenoreceptors
	- increases Ca2+ influx
		- speeds up depolarisation in pacemaker cells
			- increases AP rate
				- heart speeds up (positive chronotropic effect)
## Parasympathetic Ionotropy
- parasympathetic nerves (vagal efferents) have little effect or negative ionotropic effect
## Sympathetic Ionotropy
- mediated by β1 adrenoreceptor responding to noradrenaline
	- increasing Ca2+ influx via LTCC (during phase 2/plateau phase) and increasing sarcoplasmic Ca2+ release
		- increased contractile force in atria/ventricles (positive ionotropic effect)
