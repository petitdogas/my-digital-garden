# Neurodevelopment of movement
![the voluntary control of movement-1741172792693.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/the%20voluntary%20control%20of%20movement-1741172792693.webp)
## Pons (1-5 months)
- crawling on tummy
- hands out integrating grasp reflex
- vital tactile information received
- head and eye movements
## Midbrain (4-13 months)
crawling on hands and knees
hands open and close
connects vestibular, proprioception, and visual systems
## Cortex (8-96 months)
- upright walk and cross pattern
- cortical opposition of both hands working together but independently
## Prefrontal Cortex (up to 25 years)
- refined skills for performance
- executive functions
	- planning, organisation

# Voluntary Conscious Movement
![the voluntary control of movement-1741173164028.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/the%20voluntary%20control%20of%20movement-1741173164028.webp)
- from cortex to basal ganglia nuclei
	- perfects motor plan
- back to cerebral cortex before execution of action impulse in PNS
	- cerebral cortex to cerebellum
		- motor plan plus proprioception information
## Hierarchy of Components
- requires co-ordinated and graded patterns of muscular contractions
	- requires four distinct, but interactive systems
		- simplest movement = stretch reflex
		- UMN and LMN
			- descending tracts e.g. corticospinal tract
		- cerebellum
		- basal ganglia
	- all somatopically organised
### LMN
- produce muscle contractions via activation of [[Medical School/Year 1/loco/week 2/neuromuscular junction#Small and Large Motor Units\|motor units]]
	- strength of contraction dependent on number of active motor units
### UMN
- produce voluntary movements
### Cerebellum
- coordinate muscle movement
- select correct sequences
	- like how getting home from uni is automatic
### Basal ganglia
- initiation and maintenance of movements
- contains motor programs

# Motor Neurones
## Lower Motor Neurones (LMN)
- located in anterior horn of spinal cord and in cranial nerve nuclei in brainstem
- all voluntary movements rely on direct innervation from a motor neurone
### Damage
- flaccid paralysis (weakness)
- hypotonia
- fasciculations
- absent deep tendon reflexes
- muscle atrophy
#### Causes
- poliomyelitis
- motor neurone disease
- spinal cord injury
## Upper Motor Neurones (UMN)
- do not innervate muscle directly
	- carry voluntary motor commands to the LMNs
		- synapse in/directly onto LMNs
- cell bodies mostly in primary motor cortex
- contribute to four functionally distinct motor pathways
	- [[Medical School/Year 1/bb/week 1/organisation of the spinal cord#Corticospinal\|corticospinal tract]] (corticobulbar tract)
		- precise movements
	- rubrospinal tract
		- movement of large muscles
		- facilitates flexor movement
	- [[Medical School/Year 1/bb/week 1/the voluntary control of movement#Vestibulospinal\|vestibulospinal]] and [[Medical School/Year 1/bb/week 1/the voluntary control of movement#Rubrospinal Tract\|rubrospinal]] tracts
		- posture and balance
		- muscle tone
		- position of head and limbs
### Organisation and location of the UMN pathways

# Descending Tracts
![the voluntary control of movement-1741174995677.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/the%20voluntary%20control%20of%20movement-1741174995677.webp)
## Corticospinal Tract (Corticobulbar Tract)
![the voluntary control of movement-1741174231901.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/the%20voluntary%20control%20of%20movement-1741174231901.webp)
- highest order of motor functions
- most directs control of fine, digital movements
- many of the tract's fibres terminate on interneurones of the spinal cord
	- 55% at cervical
	- 20% at thoracic
	- 25% at lumbosacral
- lateral CST controls **distal** musculature
- ventral CST controls **axial** musculature
## Rubrospinal Tract
![the voluntary control of movement-1741174459539.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/the%20voluntary%20control%20of%20movement-1741174459539.webp)
- starts in red nucleus and terminates by synapsing on interneurones in the spinal cord
	- most terminate in **cervical** spinal cord, though some go the whole length
	- red nucleus receives input from **cerebral cortex and cerebellum**
- modulates motor tone
	- flexor contraction will also lead to extensor relaxation and vice versa
- facilitates withdrawal reflex and inhibits contraction of anti-gravity muscles
	- prevents decerebrate posture
		- ![the voluntary control of movement-1741174435168.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/the%20voluntary%20control%20of%20movement-1741174435168.webp)
## Reticulospinal (medullary and pontine)
- reticular formation to spinal cord
- ipsilateral pathways, but lateral reticulospinal tract is bilateral
- both excitatory and inhibitory activity
	- **pontine** = excitatory --> alpha and gamma motor neurones of extensors of lower limb (standing)
	- **medullary** = inhibitory --> inhibitory to alpha and gamma motor neurones of extensors
- assists the CST
- controls autonomic nervous system outflow
- lesions to reticulospinal tract affects all functions
	- very stiff
	- uncoordinated
## Vestibulospinal
- starts vestibular nuclei to spinal cord
	- head/eye coordination
	- maintaining balance and upright posture
	- vestibulospinal reflex
		- ![the voluntary control of movement-1741174822639.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/the%20voluntary%20control%20of%20movement-1741174822639.webp)
- damage results in **ataxia** (especially when eyes closed)

# Role of the Motor Cortex in Movement
- voluntary movements require proprioception to know where the body is and where it intends to go, as well as selecting a plan of how to get there
	- plan must be held in memory until it is required
- functions of the UMNs
	- excitation
	- inhibition
	- reflex modulation
	- efference copy (for smooth movemnts)
	- activation of other brainstem UMNs
		- reticular formation and red nucleus

# Efference Copy Signals
- distinguishes our movements from sensory input vs movements caused by the outside world
- motor signal from the CNS to the periphery = efference
	- internal copy of an efferent movement producing signal
		- can then be compared to the sensory input that results
- reduce cognitive load by
	- decreasing sensory processing of reafferent information
- we cannot tickle ourselves as we have generated an efference copy (the efference copy tell us we are touching ourselves), whereas for other people tickling us we don’t have the efference copy of the movements that touch us

# Cortical Regions Involved in Motor Control
![the voluntary control of movement-1741175203704.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%201/attachments/the%20voluntary%20control%20of%20movement-1741175203704.webp)
- A = prefrontal cortex
- B = frontal eye fields
- C = pre-motor cortex
	- lateral and supplementary cortex
- D = primary motor cortex
## Motor Cortex
- ready, steady, go
	- ready
		- posterior parietal cortex (Brodmann 5&7)
			- decision to move and funtinoal consequences of action
			- urgency
			- visuo-motor coordination
				- locate objects in space
	- steady
		- association motor cortex (Brodmann 6)
			- pre-motor - external cues
			- supplementary and presupplementary motor – internal cues
			- plans to move are stored until required
	- go
		- primary motor cortex (Brodmann 4)
			- instruction to move – activation of descending pathways
## Cerebellum
- coordinates complicated multi-joint movements
- acts as comparator or predictor of movement
- receives direct input from muscles and compares it with the intended signal for movement
- damage results in un-coordinated movements
### Functions of the Cerebellum
#### Vestibulo-cerebellum
- balance and posture
- coordinates eye and head movements
- damage impairs ability to stand up, maintain posture
- cerebellar nystagmus
#### Spino-cerebellum
- locomotion
- voluntary movements of arms nad legs
- damage = overshoot and intention tremor, impaired gait
#### Cerebro-cerebellum
- skilled motor tasks
	- speech, hand-eye coordination, cognitive eye movements
- damage leads to ataxia - failure of smooth muscle progression
## Basal Ganglia
- five nuclei
	- caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and subthalamic nuclei
	- concerned with initiation and maintenance of motor actions
		- decides what we are going to do next
- does not directly regulate the executino fo movements
- scale the strength of response and organise correct sequence of activity
### Brake Theory
- to keep still, put the brakes on all movements except reflexes maintaining posture
- to move, apply a brake to some postural reflexes and release the brake on voluntary movement
- damage leads to
	- tremors
	- involuntary muscle movements
	- abnormal increase in muscle tone
	- difficulty initiating movement
	- abnormal posture
	- Parkinson disease
## Muscle Tone
- tension in the muscle due to a partial state of contraction in some fibres
- maintained reflexively (by stretch and reflexes and gamma motoneurons) and adjusted to the needs of posture and movement
- also regulated by descending motor pathways 
- Golgi tendon organs detects tension in the tendon
	- spinocerebellar tract and interneurone in SC
	- inhibition of alpha motor neurones causes muscle relaxation relieving tension in the muscle
