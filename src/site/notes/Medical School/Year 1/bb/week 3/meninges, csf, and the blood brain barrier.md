## Meninges
![introduction to the central nervous system-20241029110946820.png](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/introduction%20to%20the%20central%20nervous%20system-20241029110946820.png)
### Dura mater
- attached to the inside of the skull
- folds back on itself (double layered)
	- periosteal layer attached to the bones of the skull
	- meningeal layer fused with the periosteal layer (except at dural sinuses)
	- falx cerebri, tentorium cerebelli and falx cerebelli are double layers of meningeal layer
	- forms venous sinuses e.g. superior sagittal sinus
- thick, fibrous
#### Nerve Supply
- CN V and X
	- referred pain to the head from above the tentorium cerebelli
- spinal nerves C1-3
- sympathetic
#### Blood Supply
- internal carotid, external carotid, and vertebral arteries
	- middle meningeal artery biggest branch of exernal carotid
		- think of a pterion injury
### Arachnoid mater
![introduction to the central nervous system-1742296849745.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/funmed/week%206/attachments/introduction%20to%20the%20central%20nervous%20system-1742296849745.webp)
- avascular and not attached to meningeal dura
- thinner, more delicate
- outer compact layer (barrier cells) and inner trabecular meshwork containing CSF
- subarachnoid space filled with CSF, which buffers and protects the brain and spinal cord
### Pia mater
- thin membrane loosely connected to arachnoid
- attached to the basement lamina of the brain
- only absent at natural openings between ventricles
	- median and lateral apertures

## Meningeal Blood Supply
![meninges, csf, and the blood brain barrier-1742296324687.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%203/attachments/meninges,%20csf,%20and%20the%20blood%20brain%20barrier-1742296324687.webp)
- blood vessels found within dura
- bridging veins cross the dura arachnoid interface
- many blood vessels are in the subarachnoid space
# Ventricular System
![meninges, csf, and the blood brain barrier-1742297222116.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%203/attachments/meninges,%20csf,%20and%20the%20blood%20brain%20barrier-1742297222116.webp)
![meninges, csf, and the blood brain barrier-1742297069929.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%203/attachments/meninges,%20csf,%20and%20the%20blood%20brain%20barrier-1742297069929.webp)
- fluid filled spaces within the centre of the brain with [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 6/introduction to the central nervous system#Cerebrospinal Fluid\|CSF]]
- 4 ventricles connected to each other and to central canal of the spinal cord
	- 2 lateral
	- 1 third
	- 1 fourth
- [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 6/histology of nerve and muscle tissue#ependymal cells (central neuroglia)\|ependymal glial cells]] help move the CSF
## Choroid Plexus
![meninges, csf, and the blood brain barrier-1742297403579.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%203/attachments/meninges,%20csf,%20and%20the%20blood%20brain%20barrier-1742297403579.webp)
![meninges, csf, and the blood brain barrier-1742297372527.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%203/attachments/meninges,%20csf,%20and%20the%20blood%20brain%20barrier-1742297372527.webp)
- forms the CSF
- fenestrated capillaries - CSF is a filtrate of blood plasma
- gaps between ependymal cells regulate the flow of CSF
- brain floats in the CSF
### CSF
- hydrostatic support and shock absorber for brain
- low protein and no cells - not buffered
	- used by central chemoreceptors to detect increased acidity (so increased pCO2)
	- stores glucose for glial cells
- pressure ranges 0.6-0.9kPa with variations due to coughing and internal compression of jugular veins
#### Flow through Ventricular System
![meninges, csf, and the blood brain barrier-1742297856916.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%203/attachments/meninges,%20csf,%20and%20the%20blood%20brain%20barrier-1742297856916.webp)
- lateral ventricles --> third ventricle --> fourth ventricle --> **central canal** and subarachnoid space
- from 4th ventricle, passes through **median aperture** (foramen of Magnedie) into cisterna magna
	- flows over the cerebral cortex in subarachnoid space to the area around falx
		- then absorbed by arachnoid granulations in **superior sagittal sinus**, joining venous blood in the superior sinus
##### Sleep and CSF Flow
- during sleep, waves of oxygenated blood and then CSF wash over the brain
	- non-REM sleep is associated with increased interstitial fluid volume and clearance of metabolic waste

# Arachnoid Granulations
![meninges, csf, and the blood brain barrier-1742298134035.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%203/attachments/meninges,%20csf,%20and%20the%20blood%20brain%20barrier-1742298134035.webp)
![meninges, csf, and the blood brain barrier-1742298144338.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%203/attachments/meninges,%20csf,%20and%20the%20blood%20brain%20barrier-1742298144338.webp)
- projections of the subarachnoid that penetrate the dura
	- they enable CSF to drain into superior sagittal sinus
# Raised Intracranial Pressure
![meninges, csf, and the blood brain barrier-1742298340538.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%203/attachments/meninges,%20csf,%20and%20the%20blood%20brain%20barrier-1742298340538.webp)
- caused by localised mass lesions
- disturbance of CSF circulation
	- obstructive hydrocephalus
		- flow of CSF **blocked in ventricular system**
	- communicating hydrocephalus
		- flow of CSF **blocked after it exits ventricles**
- obstruction of major venous sinuses
	- depressed fractures overlying venous sinuses
	- cerebral venous thrombosis
- diffuse brain oedema
- idiopathic
## Hydrocephalus
![meninges, csf, and the blood brain barrier-1742298402414.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%203/attachments/meninges,%20csf,%20and%20the%20blood%20brain%20barrier-1742298402414.webp)
![meninges, csf, and the blood brain barrier-1742298449000.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%203/attachments/meninges,%20csf,%20and%20the%20blood%20brain%20barrier-1742298449000.webp)
- usually, cerebral aqueduct is the site of the blockage
- insertion of shunt to drain CSF to heart or abdominal cavity
## Raised ICP in Adults
![meninges, csf, and the blood brain barrier-1742298553091.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%203/attachments/meninges,%20csf,%20and%20the%20blood%20brain%20barrier-1742298553091.webp)
![meninges, csf, and the blood brain barrier-1742298542119.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%203/attachments/meninges,%20csf,%20and%20the%20blood%20brain%20barrier-1742298542119.webp)
- when sutures close, the skull cannot expand
	- pressure therefore grows inside the skull
		- papilloedema (swelling of the optic disc)
		- herniation of parts of the brain

# Blood Brain Barrier
- perivascular feet of [[Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 6/histology of nerve and muscle tissue#Medical School/Year 1/funmed/week 6/introduction to the central nervous system.md Astrocytes astrocytes\|astrocytes]] are part of the blood-brain and blood-spinal cord barriers
- dura is similar to peripheral tissue
	- lymphatic vessels and fenestrated vasculature allow entry of large molecules from the blood
		- therefore dura mater has **lots of immune cells**
- arachnoid is the first impermeable barrier to the CNS parenchyma
	- endothelia cells joined by tight junctions
- astrocytes and astrocytic end feet are the final barrier before the parenchyma
	- diffusion of small molecules is restricted here to superficial layers of the parenchyma
## Astrocyte end feet
- processes of astrocytes are called end feet
- most of the surface of neuronal dendrites and cell bodies are overed by astrocyte end feet
- blood vessels in CNS are covered by end feet
	- regulate glucose uptake, converted to lactate which can be converted to pyruvate in neurones for use in [[Medical School/Year 1/met/week 2/the tca cycle and the electron transport chain\|TCA]]
	- stores [[Medical School/Year 1/met/week 2/glycogen metabolism\|glycogen]] for later use
	- regulate uptake of amino acids 
## BBB and Blood Spinal Cord Barrier
- combination of end feet and endothelial tight junctions make up the BBB/BSCB
	- end feet form a continuous wall around the capillaries
	- **endothelial tight junctions** prevent exit of materials not regulated by astrocytes
	- allows lipid soluble molecules through e.g. opiates
### BBB/BSCB Problems
- normally prevents drugs entering the brain
- BBB breaks down in certain pathological conditions
	- e.g. stress and inflammation disrupting BBB could lead to major depressive disorder
	- meningitis - inflammation breaks down BBB and allows penicillin in
	- absence of gut microbiota can impact the BBB
