| Function                            | Standard BBB                                                  | BBB at CVOs                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| protection of the brain from toxins | restricts harmful substances, preventing neurotoxicity        | exposed, allowing rapid response to toxins (e.g. vomiting reflex in the area postrema) |
| hormone and nutrient sensing        | limited direct detection of circulating signals.              | detects circulating hormones and relays signals to the hypothalamus.                   |
| homeostatic regulation              | mainly passive, requires transporters for glucose, ions, etc. | directly regulates thirst, hunger, and hormone release.                                |
# Neural control of water homeostasis
- combination of osmotic, hypovolemic, and hormonal feedback mechanisms
- direct stimulation of thirst
	- osmotic
	- hypovolaemic
- indirect stimulation of thirst
	- vasopressin
	- angiotensin II
	- atrial natriuretic peptide

## Osmotic Receptors
- subfornical organ (SFO) located along the anterodorsal wall of the third ventricle
- organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) located on the anterior wall of the third ventricle
### Increased Osmolarity
- osmoreceptors shrink --> TRPV channels open --> increased firing rate to hypothalamus 
	- TRPV is transient receptor potential channels
### Decreased Osmolarity
- osmoreceptors swell --> ion channels close --> reduced firing rate to hypothalamus
### Hypothalmic response to osmotic sensing
- OVLT and SFO osmoreceptors project mostly to the **Median Preoptic Nucleus (MnPO)** in the preoptic area
	- integrates the signals and sends instructions to **lateral hypothalamus (LH)**, **supraoptic (SON)**, and **paraventricular (PVN)** nuclei
#### Lateral Hypothalamus
- drives thirst motivation and water-seeking behaviour
#### Supraoptic (SON) and Paraventricular (PVN) nuclei 
- stimulate vasopressin (ADH) release to promote kidney water retention

## Baroreceptors as direct sensors
- drop in blood volume --> decreased firing rate of baroreceptor --> less inhibition of nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS)
- NTS signals to the hypothalamus --> activates PVN and SON
	- activation of lateral hypothalamus and ADH release
### ADH production and release
![neural control of basic drives-1742307373091.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%203/attachments/neural%20control%20of%20basic%20drives-1742307373091.webp)
- synthesised in cell bodies of magnocellular neurones in the PVN and SON
	- migrates along the supraopticâ€“hypophyseal tract to the posterior pituitary, where it is released into the circulation
## Indirect regulation via angiotensin II
- decreased blood pressure --> renin --> converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin --> ACE converts this to angiotensin II
- angiotensin II receptors in **SFO and OVLT**
	- sends signals to MnPO
		- via PVN and SON
			- stimulates ADH release, increasing water retention
			- acts on area postrema
### Angiotensin II acts on area postrema
- area postrema has AT1 receptors to angiotensin II
	- sends excitatory signals to NTS
		- NTS communicates with hypothalamus (PVN, SON)
			- release of ADH
			- modules sympathetic nervous system activity
## Indirect regulation via aldosterone
![neural control of basic drives-1742307611470.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%203/attachments/neural%20control%20of%20basic%20drives-1742307611470.webp)
### Functions of aldosterone

| Function                             | Structure         | Effect                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stimulating sodium appetite          | SFO, OVLT         | Increases craving for salty foods to restore sodium balance.                    |
| Enhancing thirst                     | SFO, Hypothalamus | Promotes drinking behavior, especially in sodium depletion.                     |
| Regulation of sympathetic tone       | NTS               | Modulates sympathetic outflow, influencing vasoconstriction and blood pressure. |
| Increasing Vasopressin (ADH) release | PVN, SON          | Enhances water retention in the kidneys to conserve fluid.                      |
## The role of lateral hypothalamus (LH)
- LH signals to the limbic system to motivates drinking behaviour via reward pathways
	- dopaminergic reward system in the **ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (Nac)**
		- that's why drinking water makes you happy :)
- regulates drinking cessation
	- OVLT and SFO stop activating MnPO, so lateral hypothalamus activity goes down

# Neural control of eating
## Internal cues
![neural control of basic drives-1742307993696.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%203/attachments/neural%20control%20of%20basic%20drives-1742307993696.webp)
- direct nutrient sensing - levels of glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids
- indirectly - hormone levels of insulin, leptin, ghrelin, gut hormones
## Hypothalamic nuclei involved in appetite regulation
![neural control of basic drives-1742308036128.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%203/attachments/neural%20control%20of%20basic%20drives-1742308036128.webp)
- arcuate nucleus - both
- paraventricular nucleus - mostly anorexigenic
- lateral hypothalamus - most orexigenic
- ventromedial nucleus - mostly anorexigenic
## Key hormones that target hypothalamic regulation of appetite

### Ghrelin
#### Orexigenic pathways
- produced by endocrine cells (X/A-like cells) in the fundus of stomach
	- when stomach is empty
		- circadian manner
		- ghrelin levels drop after a meal
#### Regulation of appetite
![neural control of basic drives-1742308426033.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%203/attachments/neural%20control%20of%20basic%20drives-1742308426033.webp)

- acts on arcuate nucleus by inhibiting NPY/AGRP neurones
	- activation of POMC/CART
	- stimulates satiety through activation of PVN
		- suppresses hunger via action on orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus
			- insulin receptors also found in limbic system
### Gut-brain signalling: key hormones and vagal afferents
![neural control of basic drives-1742308603715.webp](/img/user/Medical%20School/Year%201/bb/week%203/attachments/neural%20control%20of%20basic%20drives-1742308603715.webp)
- cholecystokinin (CCK) is produced by duodenum after a meal (fat and protein rich)
- peptide YY (PYY) and glucagon-like peptise are produced in ileum and colon
- signal to the brain to stop eating through the vagus nerve (CN X) --> NTS
- act on area postrema â€“ high density of receptors to these hormones --> sympathetic response, nausea
- have hypothalamic targets to modulate feeding behaviour

## Direct regulation of appetite
### Blood glucose levels and regulation of appetite
#### Glucose-excited neurones
- in ventromedial nucleus (VMN), arcuate nucleus (ARC), and paraventricular nucleus (PVN)
- increased glucose â†’ GLUT2 transporters allow glucose entry.
	- glucokinase converts glucose to glucose-6-phosphate.
		- increased ATP production closes ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels, leading to neurone depolarisation and activation.
			- the activation of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurones in the ARC inhibits food intake
#### Glucose-inhibited neurones
- found in arcuate nucleus (ARC), lateral hypothalamus (LHA), and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN)
- when glucose levels are low, these neurons increase firing activating orexigenic pathways
### Stomach contraction and vagus
#### Full Stomach
- mechanoreceptors in stomach wall detect stretch
	- vagal afferents transmit to NTS in brainstem
		- NTS signals to hypothalamus (arcuate nucleus, PVN)
#### Gastric Emptying
- reduced stretch receptor activation
	- vagal afferents detect lower gastric distension
	- ghrelin release from stomach stimulates vagal afferents
### Reward System
