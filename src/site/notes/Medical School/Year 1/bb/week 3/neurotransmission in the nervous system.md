# Learning Objectives
- [ ] State the main neurotransmitters and understand how the associated receptors mediate their action
- [ ] Define the term neuromodulator and give examples
- [ ] Describe how EPSPs and IPSPs are generated at excitatory and inhibitory synapses within the CNS
- [ ] Explain the importance of termination of transmitter action, and give two different examples of how this is achieve
- [ ] Be able to describe nerve conduction studies and electromyography and how they can detect peripheral nerve abnormalities including impulse conduction failure

- stimulate nerve at one point and record from another point distant along the nerve
- record time difference for the action potential to appear at two sites along the nerve and measure the distance between them
	- speed = distance/time = mean conduction velocity
- amplitude of the action potential can be recorded from the oscilloscope screen

# H reflex
- stimulation of a sensory nerve - the tibial nerve
	- travels along sensory fibres and enters S1
		- motor neurones in spinal cord fire at soleus muscle in superficial posterior leg compartment
			- muscle contraction
- assess spinal cord injuries, radiculopathy, peripheral neuropathies 
## M wave
- the muscle's direct response to electrical stimulation of the motor nerve, bypassing the spinal reflex arc
## H wave
- the reflexive response that results from the sensory nerve stimulation and the subsequent activation of the motor pathway
